<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Reality" data-slug="reality">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Professional services firms bill by the hour. Frame every minute spent on HR admin as billable time lost. Open with: "How much does a senior consultant bill per hour? RM 300? RM 500? Now, how much time do your partners spend approving claims via email?" The maths writes itself.</p>
    <h4>Segment positioning</h4>
    <p>The unique pain here isn't volume — it's inconsistency. When 5 partners approve claims differently, employees learn to route claims to the most lenient approver. This creates policy drift and fairness issues that erode trust. Position HRX as the system that makes policy enforcement automatic and consistent.</p>
    <h4>Who to target</h4>
    <p>Managing Partner or HR Director. In audit/consulting/law firms, the HR function is lean (often 2-3 people for 500+ staff). They need tools that eliminate repetitive tasks. Partners care about billable time recaptured and audit trail for client-facing compliance.</p>

<!-- ===== 4. WHERE HRX CREATES VALUE ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="Where HRX Creates Value" data-slug="value">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Professional services partners think in billable hours. Reframe: "43 hours saved per month in approval time. At your average billing rate, that's RM 12,000-21,000 in recoverable billable capacity every month." This converts an admin metric into a revenue metric.</p>
    <h4>Objection handling</h4>
    <p>"Our claims volume is manageable" — Ask about disputes. In professional services, the real cost isn't the volume — it's the 10-15% of claims that get queried, bounced back, or disputed. Each disputed claim takes 30-45 minutes of partner + HR time. HRX eliminates most disputes by validating claims against policy at submission.</p>
    <p>"We need flexibility, not rigid rules" — HRX supports tiered approval rules. Partners can still override, but the system logs it. The goal isn't rigidity — it's consistency. "Same claim, same outcome, regardless of which partner approves it."</p>
    <h4>Key value items</h4>
    <p>For professional services, the top 3 pain points are: (1) inconsistent policy application across partners, (2) claims disputes eating senior staff time, (3) lack of audit trail for internal and external audits. HRX fixes all three with configurable policy rules, automated validation, and timestamped approval chains.</p>

<!-- ===== 5. IMPACT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-white" data-title="Impact" data-slug="impact">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Key insight</h4>
    <p>The 43 hours/month number is pure senior staff time returned to billable work. For an audit firm billing RM 300/hour, that's RM 12,900/month in recoverable capacity. For a consulting firm at RM 500/hour, it's RM 21,500/month. Let the prospect do this maths themselves — it's more powerful when they calculate it.</p>
    <h4>Conversation steer</h4>
    <p>If the prospect is a multi-office firm (e.g., KL + Penang + JB), shift to standardisation: "Right now, your KL office and Penang office probably have slightly different claim policies. With HRX, one set of rules governs everything — no more 'but the Penang office lets us claim this' conversations."</p>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Approval Effort Reduction — 20-40%</h3>
        <p>HRX reduces approval effort by eliminating the back-and-forth that dominates email-based workflows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Auto-validation:</strong> Claims that comply with policy are pre-approved — managers only review flagged exceptions. This eliminates ~60% of routine approvals.</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile batch approval:</strong> Partners approve 10 claims in 2 minutes via mobile notification instead of 10 separate email threads.</li>
          <li><strong>Escalation rules:</strong> Claims not approved within 48 hours auto-escalate to the next approver. No more "stuck in inbox" delays.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>20% reduction is immediate (month 1). 40% is typical by month 3 when auto-validation rules are tuned to the firm's specific policies.</p>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Dispute Reduction</h3>
        <p>Claims disputes in professional services arise from three root causes — all addressed by HRX:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Policy ambiguity:</strong> "Is this claimable?" — HRX shows employees exactly what's covered and at what limit before they submit. No surprises.</li>
          <li><strong>Inconsistent enforcement:</strong> Partner A approves what Partner B rejects. HRX applies the same rules regardless of approver — overrides are logged with justification.</li>
          <li><strong>Late discovery:</strong> HR finds policy violations during payroll close, creating last-minute corrections. With HRX, violations are caught at submission, not at month-end.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Typical dispute volume drops 50-70% within 3 months. The remaining disputes are genuine edge cases, not system failures.</p>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Full Audit Trail</h3>
        <p>Professional services firms — especially audit firms and law practices — face heightened scrutiny on their own internal controls. HRX provides the evidence.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Approval chain:</strong> Every claim shows who submitted, who approved, when, and against which policy version. Immutable log.</li>
          <li><strong>Policy change history:</strong> When claim limits or leave policies change, the system tracks old vs new rules and which claims were processed under each version.</li>
          <li><strong>Export for audit:</strong> One-click export for internal audit, ISO certification, or LHDN investigations. Shows full PCB calculation trail per employee.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Critical for audit firms where "physician, heal thyself" scrutiny is real — your own internal controls need to be at least as strong as what you recommend to clients.</p>

<!-- ===== 7. THE INVESTMENT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Investment" data-slug="roi">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Professional services firms understand ROI intuitively — they advise clients on it. Be direct: "RM 120 per employee per year. For 800 people, that's RM 96K. You save RM 384K. Net RM 288K. And that's before counting the billable hours you recapture from approval workflows."</p>
    <h4>Pricing guidance</h4>
    <p>RM 120/employee/year is list price. For firms with 1,500+ employees (Big 4, large law firms), we can go to RM 100/employee. For pilot deals, offer 2-month free on one department (audit division or one practice group) to prove the approval time reduction.</p>
    <h4>Closing technique</h4>
    <p>For professional services, the close is about credibility: "As an audit firm, your clients expect you to use best-in-class internal controls. Running payroll on spreadsheets and email approvals is a risk you'd flag in a client engagement." Then: "Which department should we start with?"</p>

        <h3>ROI Methodology</h3>
        <p>Based on RM 120/employee/year investment vs RM 480/employee/year in recovered costs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Approval time savings:</strong> 40% reduction in 107 hours/month at RM 60/hour blended rate = RM 30,816/year for 800 employees</li>
          <li><strong>Dispute resolution:</strong> 60% fewer disputes, saving ~30 hours/month of senior staff time = RM 21,600/year</li>
          <li><strong>Billable time recaptured:</strong> Partners and managers redirect 43 hours/month from approvals to client work. At RM 200/hour average billing rate = RM 103,200/year in recoverable capacity</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance risk avoidance:</strong> Documented audit trail eliminates exposure to LHDN penalties for PCB miscalculations and EPF under-remittance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Net: RM 480 - RM 120 = RM 360 per employee. ROI = 480 / 120 = <strong>4.0x</strong></p>
        <p>Payback period: 120 / (480 / 12) = <strong>3 months</strong></p>
