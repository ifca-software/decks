# HRX Segment Deck Plan

Use: `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/hrx/outline.md`

## Objective

Sell HRX as payroll certainty + compliance automation:

- close faster
- fewer corrections
- statutory reporting reliable

Anchor unit heuristic:

- RM per employee per month (admin + error cost)

## Segment variants to build

- Manufacturing / shift work
- Retail / multi-site
- Professional services
- Hospitality (hotels, F&B)
- Construction / project-based
- BPO / call centers

Segment specs:

- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/hrx/segments/manufacturing-shift-work.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/hrx/segments/retail-multi-site.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/hrx/segments/professional-services.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/hrx/segments/hospitality-hotels-fnb.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/hrx/segments/construction-project-based.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/hrx/segments/bpo-call-centers.md`

## What changes by segment

- Slide 2: exceptions and overtime (manufacturing) vs turnover and approvals (retail) vs claims workflows (services)
- Slide 3: baseline ties to headcount and payroll complexity
- Slide 7: ROI leads with time saved + error reduction; penalties are secondary
- Slide 8: proof artifacts: exception dashboard, audit trails, statutory exports

## Defensible numbers (recommended approach)

- Admin savings = hours saved per employee x hourly cost
- Error savings = reduction in corrections x cost per correction

Avoid penalty claims unless you can point to common failure modes and show how HRX prevents them.

## Evidence artifacts to prepare

- Payroll run + exception dashboard
- Approval audit trail
- Statutory report generation/export

## Pilot offer (recommended)

- Scope: 1 unit, 1-2 payroll cycles (parallel run)
- Success criteria:
  - 0 critical payroll errors
  - close time down >= 20%
