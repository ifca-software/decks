# HRX - Construction / Project-based (Segment Spec)

## Segment

- Product: HRX
- Segment: Construction / project-based
- Primary buyer: HR/payroll lead
- Secondary buyers: Project managers, finance
- Typical environment: multiple sites, allowances, subcontractor coordination, attendance corrections

## Positioning

- One-line promise: Standardize approvals and payroll exceptions across sites with a clear audit trail.
- Status quo: site-level tracking inconsistencies and last-minute fixes.
- Unit heuristic (anchor metric): exception volume per site + days to close.

## Baseline model (defensible assumptions)

- Base inputs:
  - Sites/projects: 20
  - Headcount: 1,200
  - Exception rate: 12%
  - Cost per exception: RM 60
- Formulas:
  - Exceptions/month = headcount x exception rate
- Modeled baseline values:
  - Exceptions/month = 1,200 x 12% = 144
  - Cost/month = 144 x 60 = RM 8,640

## Impact model

- Primary lever (pick one): standard approvals reduce exceptions and disputes
- Secondary lever (pick one): faster close via cleaner inputs
- Result metrics:
  - exception volume down 25-45%
  - close time down 20-30%

## Proof plan (no named claims)

- Operational proof (dashboard): site-by-site exceptions and approval status.
- Workflow proof: approvals audit trail by supervisor.
- Export/report proof: payroll audit log.

## Discovery validation (what to measure first)

- What baseline numbers to confirm: exception drivers (attendance, allowances) and approval bottlenecks.
- What artifacts the buyer expects to see: site rollups and audit trail.

## Slide-by-slide notes (rewrite Slides 2-8)

2. Problem: site fragmentation creates payroll risk.
3. Baseline: exceptions/month.
4. Value: workflows.
5. Impact: fewer disputes.
6. How: approvals per site.
7. ROI: admin time saved.
8. Proof: dashboards.

## Pilot and risk reversal

- Scope: 3 sites, 1-2 payroll cycles
- Timeline: setup week 1, parallel run cycle 1, cutover cycle 2
- Success criteria:
  - approvals coverage 100% for pilot exceptions
  - critical payroll errors = 0

## Do / Don't

- Do: focus on standardization across sites.
- Don't: promise labor productivity.
