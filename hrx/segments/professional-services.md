# HRX - Professional Services (Segment Spec)

## Segment

- Product: HRX
- Segment: Professional services
- Primary buyer: Finance / HR ops
- Secondary buyers: Department heads
- Typical environment: claims, leave approvals, project allocations, compliance reporting

## Positioning

- One-line promise: Transparent approvals and clean payroll audit trails for claims, leave, and adjustments.
- Status quo: approvals in email, unclear policy enforcement.
- Unit heuristic (anchor metric): admin hours per employee + correction count.

## Baseline model (defensible assumptions)

- Base inputs:
  - Headcount: 800
  - Claims per employee per month: 0.8
  - Approval time per claim: 10 minutes (manager + HR)
  - Hourly cost: RM 60 blended
- Modeled baseline:
  - Claims/month = 800 x 0.8 = 640
  - Approval hours/month = 640 x (10/60) = 107 hours
  - Approval cost/month = 107 x 60 = RM 6,420

## Impact model

- Primary lever: faster approvals with policy guardrails
- Secondary lever: fewer corrections and disputes
- Result metrics (modeled):
  - approval effort down 20-40%

## Proof plan

- Operational proof: approvals queue dashboard.
- Workflow proof: claims/leave approval workflow.
- Export/report proof: audit trail for changes.

## Discovery validation (what to measure first)

- Confirm baseline: claims volume, approval steps, and dispute/correction frequency.
- Confirm buyer proof bar: required approval policy controls and reporting granularity.

## Slide-by-slide notes (rewrite Slides 2-8)

2. Problem: time lost in approvals and policy ambiguity.
3. Baseline: claims volume and approval hours.
4. Value: workflows + reporting.
5. Impact: hours saved.
6. How: policy-driven approvals.
7. ROI: time saved + fewer corrections.
8. Proof: approvals dashboard + audit trail.

## Pilot and risk reversal

- Scope: claims + leave for one department, 30 days
- Timeline: setup (week 1), go-live (week 2), measure (week 3-4)
- Success criteria: approval time down >= 25%

## Do / Don't

- Do: emphasize transparency and auditability.
- Don't: promise culture change.
