# HRX - Retail / Multi-site (Segment Spec)

## Segment

- Product: HRX
- Segment: Retail / multi-site
- Primary buyer: HR operations
- Secondary buyers: Regional managers, Finance
- Typical environment: many outlets, turnover, variable schedules, approvals across managers

## Positioning

- One-line promise: Close payroll faster across every outlet with self-service and standardized approvals.
- Status quo: attendance and claims submitted inconsistently; approvals slow.
- Unit heuristic (anchor metric): days to close payroll + RM per employee per month admin.

## Baseline model (defensible assumptions)

- Base inputs:
  - Headcount: 3,000
  - Payroll close: 5 days
  - Manager approvals: 300 managers
  - Admin time: 1 hour/employee/month
  - Admin cost: RM 40/hour
- Modeled baseline:
  - Admin cost/employee/year = 1 x 40 x 12 = RM 480

## Impact model

- Primary lever: reduce admin time and approval delays
- Secondary lever: reduce correction rate
- Result metrics (modeled):
  - close time down 20-40%
  - admin time down 25-40%

## Proof plan

- Operational proof: outlet-level exceptions and approval status.
- Workflow proof: self-service submissions + approvals.
- Export/report proof: statutory exports.

## Discovery validation (what to measure first)

- Confirm baseline: approval bottlenecks by role/region and payroll correction count.
- Confirm buyer proof bar: statutory report formats and self-service scope.

## Slide-by-slide notes (rewrite Slides 2-8)

2. Problem: many outlets, inconsistent inputs, slow approvals.
3. Baseline: close days + admin hours.
4. Value: self-service + approvals + dashboards.
5. Impact: faster close and fewer errors.
6. How: workflows and reporting.
7. ROI: time saved scales with headcount.
8. Proof: outlet dashboard + audit trail.

## Pilot and risk reversal

- Scope: one region, 1-2 payroll cycles
- Timeline: setup (week 1), parallel run (cycle 1), tune + cutover (cycle 2)
- Success criteria: close time down >= 20%, critical errors = 0

## Do / Don't

- Do: emphasize standardization.
- Don't: claim turnover reduction.
