# HRX - Slide Outline (Draft Copy)

## Deck plan (how to use this outline)
- Build 1 core deck first, then clone into 2-3 segment variants.
- Default structure: 10 slides, plus optional Assumptions, Implementation, Pilot.
- Variants should live as separate decks (for later): `hrx/<segment>/index.html` (e.g. `hrx/manufacturing/`, `hrx/retail/`).
- What changes by segment: Slides 2-8 (Problem, Baseline, Value, Impact, Proof, Assumptions). Slides 1, 9, 10 stay mostly stable.
- Keep ROI defensible: lead with time saved and error reduction; penalties are a secondary upside.

## Target segments (recommended)
| Segment | Anchor metric | Tailor the story | Proof to show |
|---|---|---|---|
| Manufacturing / shift work | payroll exceptions + overtime leakage | time & attendance, allowances, approvals | exception dashboard + audit trail |
| Retail / multi-site | time to close payroll + compliance | high turnover, many locations | self-service + approvals + statutory reports |
| Professional services | approvals + claims + transparency | leave/claims workflows | workflow + reporting + audit log |

## 1. Title
- HRX for Payroll, HR, and Compliance
- Reduce payroll errors and improve workforce visibility
- IFCA MSC Berhad · [Month Year] · Confidential

## 2. The Problem
- Payroll runs are manual and error-prone
- Compliance reporting is slow and risky
- HR data is fragmented across tools

## 3. Baseline Economics
- Payroll error rate: 2.5%
- Time to close payroll: 5 days
- Compliance penalties: RM 180,000 per year

## Heuristics used
- 2.5% error rate assumes 25 errors per 1,000 payslips per cycle
- 5-day close assumes 2 days data fixes + 2 days approvals + 1 day disbursement
- RM 180k penalties assume 3 late filings at RM 30k each + RM 90k corrections

## Unit heuristic (anchor metric)
- Unit: RM per employee per month (admin + error cost)
- Translation: saving 1 admin hour/month at RM 40/hour = RM 480/employee/year

## ICP fit (who its for / not for)
- Best for: 500+ headcount, multi-site payroll complexity, frequent adjustments, and compliance exposure
- Not for: micro teams using fully-managed payroll with minimal statutory reporting

## 4. Where HRX Creates Value
- Automated payroll with audit-ready logs
- Compliance reporting in one click
- Unified employee data and approvals

## 5. Impact
- Reduce payroll errors by 70%
- Cut payroll close time by 50%
- Eliminate compliance penalties

## 6. How It Works
- Core HR: employee records and workflows
- Payroll: rules, deductions, and audits
- Compliance: statutory reports and filings

## 7. Investment and ROI
- Cost: RM 120 per employee / year
- Savings: RM 480 per employee / year in admin time and penalties
- ROI: 4x in 6 months

## ROI logic
- Savings assume 1 hour/month admin saved x RM 40/hour = RM 480/year per employee
- Eliminating penalties adds RM 180k annual upside

## 8. Proof (make it defensible)
- Show 1 anonymized before/after: close time, correction count, and error rate (validated during discovery)
- Show 1 proxy proof: statutory report generation + approval audit trail
- Show 1 operational proof: exception dashboard (late attendance, overtime, changes)

## Build checklist (so this becomes a real deck)
- Screens: payroll run, exceptions, approvals, statutory reports export
- 1-page ROI calculator inputs: headcount, admin hours, hourly cost, error/correction cost
- One anonymized mini-case: parallel run -> error reduction -> faster close

## 9. Why IFCA
- Built for Malaysian statutory requirements
- Integrates with IFCAx finance
- Fast deployment and local support

## 10. Next Step
- Start with one business unit
- Prove payroll accuracy and time savings
- Roll out across all sites

## Assumptions slide (optional)
- Assumptions: 2.5% payroll error rate, 5-day close, RM 180k penalties
- Inputs to ROI: 1 hour/month admin saved per employee, penalties eliminated

## Implementation slide (optional)
- Week 1: payroll rules, org structure, and statutory setup
- Week 2-3: parallel run with one payroll cycle
- Week 4: cutover and compliance reporting pack

## Pilot / risk reversal (optional)
- Pilot scope: one unit, 1-2 payroll cycles
- Success criteria: 0 critical payroll errors and close time down >= 20% in pilot

## Glossary candidates
- EPF, SOCSO, EIS, PCB, LHDN
