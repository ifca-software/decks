<!-- ===== 2. THE REALITY ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Reality" data-slug="reality">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Co-working operators are startup-minded — they think in terms of churn rate, NPS, and customer experience. Don't lead with "lease management." Lead with: "How many billing adjustments does your team process each month?" When they say "a lot," ask: "And how many of those turn into disputes?" The link between billing errors and churn is the hook — co-working customers switch operators over a single bad billing experience.</p>
    <h4>Key difference from other segments</h4>
    <p>Co-working has 3 unique pain points: frequent plan changes (monthly upgrades, downgrades, add-ons creating proration complexity), short lease terms (1–12 months making churn-to-billing-error ratio high), and blended revenue streams (desk rental + meeting rooms + printing + F&B + event space all on one invoice). Every plan change is a billing adjustment waiting to become a dispute.</p>

<!-- ===== 4. VALUE CREATION ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="Value Creation" data-slug="value">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Walk through the adjustment reduction. Co-working operators understand that billing accuracy is a customer experience issue, not just a finance issue. The 75 to 45 adjustment drop is meaningful — it means 30 fewer customers per month dealing with a billing problem. Ask: "What's your NPS? Now imagine 30 fewer billing complaints per month — what does that do to your NPS?"</p>
    <h4>Objection handling</h4>
    <p>"We use Xero/QuickBooks for billing" — Great for accounting, but Xero doesn't handle plan changes with effective dates, proration rules, or meeting room usage billing. You're doing all of that manually and then entering the result into Xero. RentX automates the calculation and pushes the correct amount to your accounting system.</p>
    <p>"Our margins are thin — we can't afford another system" — Your margins are thin precisely because of billing inefficiency. RM 750/month in admin time + RM 2,500/month in dispute costs = RM 3,250/month in billing-related costs. RentX costs RM 3,750/month (500 customers x RM 7.50) but saves RM 1,300/month in direct costs plus reduces churn. The real ROI is in retention, not just admin savings.</p>

<!-- ===== 5. MODELED IMPACT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-white" data-title="Modeled Impact" data-slug="impact">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Key insight</h4>
    <p>The RM 1,300/month savings is conservative — it only counts direct admin time and dispute cost reduction. The bigger story is churn prevention. Co-working customers who experience a billing dispute are 3x more likely to leave within 90 days. If RentX prevents even 2 churns per month at RM 2,000/month average revenue per customer, that's RM 4,000/month in protected revenue — making the true value closer to RM 5,300/month or RM 63,600/year. Lead with the conservative number but mention the churn story.</p>

        <h3>Change Control</h3>
        <p>Co-working customers change plans frequently — upgrading from hot desk to dedicated desk, adding meeting room credits, switching to a larger suite. Each change creates a proration event that is currently calculated manually.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before:</strong> Plan changes noted in email or Slack — effective dates unclear, proration calculated by hand</li>
          <li><strong>After:</strong> Every change logged with effective date, auto-prorated, and approved before billing adjustment</li>
          <li><strong>Impact:</strong> 60% of billing adjustments are caused by plan change errors — change control eliminates this category</li>

        <p>Co-working billing is complex: base desk rate + meeting room usage + printing + parking + event space + F&B credits, with promotional discounts, referral credits, and corporate rates all layered on top. Manual calculation is error-prone.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before:</strong> Billing calculated in Excel with manual overrides — errors compound across 500 invoices</li>
          <li><strong>After:</strong> Rule-based engine applies proration, discounts, and usage charges automatically</li>

        <h3>Audit Trail</h3>
        <p>When a customer disputes a charge, the current process is: search email for the plan change agreement, find the original invoice, check the credit note, and reconstruct what happened. This takes 30–45 minutes per dispute. With RentX, the entire history is one click away.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before:</strong> Dispute resolution requires reconstructing history from emails, invoices, and bank statements</li>
          <li><strong>After:</strong> Complete timeline of plan changes, invoices, adjustments, and payments per customer</li>

<!-- ===== 7. INVESTMENT & ROI ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Investment" data-slug="roi">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Pricing</h4>
    <p>RM 7.50/customer/month (RM 90/customer/year) for co-working spaces. For multi-location operators (3+ locations), negotiate to RM 6/customer/month. The direct ROI is modest (1.3x) but the churn prevention story is compelling — preventing 2 churns/month adds RM 48,000/year in protected revenue, making the true ROI closer to 4x.</p>
    <h4>Closing technique</h4>
    <p>Co-working operators think in terms of customer experience. Ask: "What happens when a customer gets an incorrect invoice?" They'll describe the complaint cycle. Then say: "RentX makes that scenario 40% less likely — and when it does happen, resolution takes 5 minutes instead of 45." The emotional hook is customer satisfaction, not cost savings.</p>

        <p>True value includes churn prevention: each billing dispute makes a customer 3x more likely to leave. Preventing 2 churns/month at RM 2,000/month average = RM 48,000/year in protected revenue. Total value: RM 15,600 + RM 48,000 = RM 63,600/year = <strong>1.4x total ROI</strong>.</p>
