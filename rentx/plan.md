# RentX Segment Deck Plan

Use: `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/rentx/outline.md`

## Objective

Sell RentX as a collections and renewal operating system:

- arrears down
- admin effort down
- renewals managed like a pipeline

Anchor unit heuristic:

- RM per unit per month (arrears + admin)

## Segment variants to build

- Retail malls
- Residential portfolios
- Industrial / warehousing
- Commercial office landlords
- Student housing
- Co-working / serviced offices

Segment specs:

- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/rentx/segments/retail-malls.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/rentx/segments/residential-portfolios.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/rentx/segments/industrial-warehousing.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/rentx/segments/commercial-office-landlords.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/rentx/segments/student-housing.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/rentx/segments/co-working-serviced-offices.md`

## What changes by segment

- Slide 2: disputes + tenant comms (malls) vs renewals + payment channels (residential) vs compliance + escalations (industrial)
- Slide 3: baseline uses rent/unit, arrears %, collection effort
- Slide 5: keep occupancy lift minimal; lead with arrears and admin reduction
- Slide 8: proof artifacts vary: dispute workflow vs payment ledger vs compliance docs

## Defensible numbers (recommended approach)

- Base: monthly rent per unit x units
- Arrears savings = base x arrears reduction percentage
- Admin savings = hours saved x blended hourly cost

## Evidence artifacts to prepare

- Billing run + reminder schedule
- Payment ledger and aging report
- Renewal pipeline dashboard
- Dispute tracker (especially malls)

## Pilot offer (recommended)

- Scope: 1 property, 60 days
- Success criteria:
  - invoices issued on time >= 95%
  - arrears down >= 20% OR collection effort down >= 25%
