# RentX - Slide Outline (Draft Copy)

## Deck plan (how to use this outline)
- Build 1 core deck first, then clone into 2-3 segment variants.
- Default structure: 10 slides, plus optional Assumptions, Implementation, Pilot.
- Variants should live as separate decks (for later): `rentx/<segment>/index.html` (e.g. `rentx/mall/`, `rentx/residential/`).
- What changes by segment: Slides 2-8 (Problem, Baseline, Value, Impact, Proof, Assumptions). Slides 1, 9, 10 stay mostly stable.
- Keep numbers defensible: tie ROI to arrears reduction and admin hours saved; avoid overstating occupancy lift.

## Target segments (recommended)
| Segment | Anchor metric | Tailor the story | Proof to show |
|---|---|---|---|
| Retail malls | arrears % + renewal pipeline | arrears aging, disputes, tenant comms | aging report + dispute tracker + reminder automation |
| Residential portfolios | RM/unit/month collections cost | auto reminders, payment channels, renewals | payment ledger + auto invoices + tenant portal |
| Industrial / warehouse | lease compliance + billing accuracy | escalation clauses, insurance docs, notices | contract repository + automated escalation |

## 1. Title
- RentX for Property Leasing and Rental Operations
- Reduce arrears, increase occupancy, and automate collections
- IFCA MSC Berhad · [Month Year] · Confidential

## 2. The Problem
- Leasing teams run renewals manually
- Arrears and dispute tracking are inconsistent
- Tenant experience is fragmented across portals and email

## 3. Baseline Economics
- Occupancy: 82%
- Arrears rate: 6.5%
- Renewal cycle time: 30 days
- Collection cost: RM 12,000 per month

## Heuristics used
- 82% occupancy assumes 1-2 vacant units per 10 at any given month
- 6.5% arrears assumes 2-3 months of late payments across 1 in 5 tenants
- 30-day renewal assumes 10 days negotiation + 10 days approvals + 10 days admin
- RM 12k/month collections assumes 2 FTE x RM 4.5k + RM 3k in fees

## Unit heuristic (anchor metric)
- Unit: RM per unit per month (arrears + admin)
- Translation: reducing arrears by 3% on RM 1,800 rent is ~RM 650/unit/year

## ICP fit (who its for / not for)
- Best for: landlords/operators with recurring arrears, multi-property renewals, and manual billing
- Not for: small portfolios with few tenants and already-automated billing

## 4. Where RentX Creates Value
- Automated billing, reminders, and escalation
- Central lease repository and renewal workflows
- Tenant self-service for issues and payments

## 5. Impact
- Reduce arrears by 45%
- Increase occupancy by 4 points
- Lower collection cost by 35%

## 6. How It Works
- Lease: templates and digital approvals
- Bill: automated invoices and payment tracking
- Serve: tenant portal and service requests

## 7. Investment and ROI
- Cost: RM 180 per unit / year
- Savings: RM 520 per unit / year from lower arrears and admin time
- ROI: 2.9x in 5 months

## ROI logic
- Savings assume 3% arrears reduction on RM 1,800 monthly rent = RM 650/unit/year
- Admin time reduced 1 day/unit/year at RM 200/day blended cost

## 8. Proof (make it defensible)
- Show 1 anonymized before/after: arrears %, DSO, and collection effort (validated during discovery)
- Show 1 proxy proof: automated invoice/reminder schedule + escalation rules + payment ledger
- Show 1 operational proof: arrears aging report, dispute tracker, and renewal pipeline

## Build checklist (so this becomes a real deck)
- Screens: billing run, reminder schedule, arrears aging, renewal dashboard, tenant portal payment
- 1-page ROI calculator inputs: rent/unit, arrears %, reduction %, units, admin hours
- One anonymized mini-case: 1 property go-live -> arrears down -> time saved

## 9. Why IFCA
- Local compliance and billing rules
- Integrates with IFCAx accounting
- Fast rollout for multi-site portfolios

## 10. Next Step
- Pilot with one property
- Prove arrears reduction
- Expand portfolio-wide

## Assumptions slide (optional)
- Assumptions: 82% occupancy, 6.5% arrears, RM 12k monthly collections cost
- Inputs to ROI: 3% arrears reduction on RM 1,800 rent, 1 day admin saved per unit

## Implementation slide (optional)
- Week 1: tenant, lease, and billing setup for one property
- Week 2: payment channels + reminders + arrears workflows
- Week 3-4: go live and measure arrears + time saved

## Pilot / risk reversal (optional)
- Pilot scope: 1 property, 60 days
- Success criteria: arrears down >= 20% and 95%+ invoices issued on time with full audit trail

## Glossary candidates
- DSO, AR, NLA, GFA
