# PropertyX - Slide Outline (Draft Copy)

## Deck plan (how to use this outline)
- Build 1 core deck first, then clone into 2-3 segment variants.
- Default structure: 10 slides, plus optional Assumptions, Implementation, Pilot.
- Variants should live as separate decks (for later): `propertyx/<segment>/index.html` (e.g. `propertyx/reit/`, `propertyx/mixed-use/`).
- What changes by segment: Slides 2-8 (Problem, Baseline, Value, Impact, Proof, Assumptions). Slides 1, 9, 10 stay mostly stable.
- Keep claims defensible: position NOI lift as a modeled outcome, with OpEx visibility as the immediate win.

## Target segments (recommended)
| Segment | Anchor metric | Tailor the story | Proof to show |
|---|---|---|---|
| REIT portfolios | OpEx/sqft/month + NOI delta | owner reporting, KPI governance | owner pack automation + OpEx breakdown |
| Mixed-use developers | reporting cycle time + cost control | consolidation across assets | portfolio dashboard + data consolidation |
| Corporate real estate | service levels + spend control | vendor performance and budgets | vendor scorecards + budget vs actual |

## 1. Title
- PropertyX for Integrated Property Management
- One platform for assets, tenants, and financial performance
- IFCA MSC Berhad · [Month Year] · Confidential

## 2. The Problem
- Property data is split across systems
- Owners lack real-time performance visibility
- Compliance and asset condition reporting is manual

## 3. Baseline Economics
- Portfolio NOI: RM 90M
- Operating cost per sqft: RM 4.80
- Reporting cycle time: 18 days

## Heuristics used
- RM 90M NOI assumes RM 180M gross income at ~50% NOI margin
- RM 4.80 per sqft/month OpEx assumes RM 2.40 utilities + RM 1.50 maintenance + RM 0.90 admin
- 18-day reporting assumes 5 days data collection + 8 days consolidation + 5 days review

## Unit heuristic (anchor metric)
- Unit: RM per sqft per month (OpEx), plus NOI delta
- Translation: 1% OpEx reduction on RM 120M OpEx = RM 1.2M/year

## ICP fit (who its for / not for)
- Best for: multi-asset portfolios where reporting and ops data are fragmented across systems
- Not for: single-building owners with low reporting requirements

## 4. Where PropertyX Creates Value
- Unified asset, tenant, and financial view
- Automated reporting and KPI dashboards
- Better visibility to improve NOI

## 5. Impact
- Reduce reporting time by 60%
- Improve NOI by 6%
- Lower operating cost per sqft by 10%

## 6. How It Works
- Portfolio: asset registry and KPIs
- Operations: maintenance and vendor tracking
- Finance: billing, collections, and reporting

## 7. Investment and ROI
- Cost: RM 240,000 per year
- Savings: RM 1.2M in admin and ops costs
- ROI: 5x in 9 months

## ROI logic
- Savings assume 1% OpEx reduction on RM 120M annual OpEx = RM 1.2M
- Reporting automation removes ~4 FTE at RM 90k/year each

## 8. Proof (make it defensible)
- Show 1 anonymized before/after: reporting cycle time and OpEx/sqft (validated during discovery)
- Show 1 proxy proof: single portfolio dashboard pulling ops + finance + tenant signals
- Show 1 operational proof: monthly owner pack generated from system data (not spreadsheets)

## Build checklist (so this becomes a real deck)
- Screens: portfolio KPIs, OpEx breakdown, owner pack export, vendor scorecards
- 1-page ROI calculator inputs: sqft, OpEx/sqft, % reduction, reporting effort (FTE)
- One anonymized mini-case: first automated owner pack -> cycle time down -> OpEx insights

## 9. Why IFCA
- Built for ASEAN property portfolios
- Integrates with FMX and RentX
- Local support and rollout team

## 10. Next Step
- Start with one portfolio segment
- Prove visibility and savings
- Expand to full portfolio

## Assumptions slide (optional)
- Assumptions: RM 90M NOI, RM 4.80/sqft/month OpEx, 18-day reporting
- Inputs to ROI: 1% OpEx reduction on RM 120M OpEx, 4 FTE eliminated

## Implementation slide (optional)
- Week 1-2: portfolio KPI model + reporting templates
- Week 3-4: integrate or load key data sources (leases, billing, vendors)
- Week 5-6: first automated monthly owner pack

## Pilot / risk reversal (optional)
- Pilot scope: one asset class or one cluster, 60 days
- Success criteria: owner pack cycle time down >= 30% and OpEx visibility by category >= 95%

## Glossary candidates
- NOI, OpEx, KPI, CAPEX
