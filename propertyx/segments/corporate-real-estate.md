# PropertyX - Corporate Real Estate (Segment Spec)

## Segment

- Product: PropertyX
- Segment: Corporate real estate
- Primary buyer: Head of facilities / corporate real estate
- Secondary buyers: Finance, procurement
- Typical environment: internal cost center, service levels, spend control, vendor performance

## Positioning

- One-line promise: Control spend and service levels with vendor visibility and budget governance.
- Status quo: vendor-heavy ops, limited performance visibility, reactive reporting.
- Unit heuristic (anchor metric): RM per sqft per month (OpEx) + vendor KPI scorecards.

## Baseline model (defensible assumptions)

- Base inputs:
  - Total sqft: 1,000,000
  - OpEx: RM 4.80/sqft/month
  - Vendor share of OpEx: 60%
- Formulas:
  - Annual vendor OpEx = sqft x OpEx/sqft/month x 12 x vendor share
- Modeled baseline:
  - Annual vendor OpEx = 1,000,000 x 4.80 x 12 x 60% = RM 34.56M

## Impact model

- Primary lever: vendor performance + spend governance (small % reduction)
- Secondary lever: faster reporting and approvals
- Result metrics (modeled):
  - 0.5-1.5% reduction on vendor OpEx

## Proof plan (no named claims)

- Operational proof: vendor scorecards + budget vs actual.
- Workflow proof: approval workflows for spend and changes.
- Export/report proof: monthly governance pack.

## Discovery validation (what to measure first)

- Confirm baseline: vendor spend, budget structure, and current KPI reporting cadence.
- Confirm buyer proof bar: which vendor KPIs matter (response time, uptime, cost, compliance).

## Slide-by-slide notes (rewrite Slides 2-8)

2. Problem:
- "Vendors run the building; you need performance visibility." Make it about control.

3. Baseline economics:
- show vendor spend base.

4. Value levers:
- scorecards, budgets, governance.

5. Impact:
- translate 1% on vendor OpEx into RM.

6. How it works:
- KPI governance loop.

7. Investment and ROI:
- ROI anchored on small % vendor spend reduction.

8. Proof:
- show vendor scorecards + budget pack.

## Pilot and risk reversal

- Scope: top 5 vendors + one region/site, 60 days
- Timeline: KPI + budget model (week 1-2), load vendor data (week 3-4), first pack (week 5-6), measure (week 7-8)
- Success criteria:
  - vendor KPIs reported monthly
  - budget variance visibility >= 95%

## Do / Don't

- Do: keep it about spend control and service levels.
- Don't: overlap with FMX work-order level detail unless desired.
