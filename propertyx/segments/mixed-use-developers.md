# PropertyX - Mixed-use Developers (Segment Spec)

## Segment

- Product: PropertyX
- Segment: Mixed-use developers
- Primary buyer: COO / head of property
- Secondary buyers: Finance, ops leads for each asset type
- Typical environment: office + retail + hospitality mix, multiple systems, manual consolidation

## Positioning

- One-line promise: One portfolio view across asset types - without manual consolidation.
- Status quo: separate systems per asset type, reporting stitched together in spreadsheets.
- Unit heuristic (anchor metric): reporting cycle days + OpEx/sqft by asset type.

## Baseline model (defensible assumptions)

- Base inputs:
  - Asset types: 3
  - Reporting cycle: 18 days
  - Reporting effort: 4 FTE equivalent
  - Blended FTE cost: RM 90,000/year
- Modeled baseline:
  - Reporting labor = 4 x 90,000 = RM 360,000/year

## Impact model

- Primary lever: reduce reporting effort and cycle time via consolidation
- Secondary lever: OpEx visibility
- Result metrics (modeled):
  - reporting effort down 30-50%
  - reporting cycle down 30-60%

## Proof plan (no named claims)

- Operational proof: cross-asset dashboard (same KPIs, different asset types).
- Workflow proof: data capture and validation steps.
- Export/report proof: standardized owner pack.

## Discovery validation (what to measure first)

- Confirm baseline: current reporting workflow across asset types and manual effort.
- Confirm buyer proof bar: which KPIs must be standardized across assets.

## Slide-by-slide notes (rewrite Slides 2-8)

2. Problem:
- "Three asset types. Three systems. One spreadsheet pack." Highlight coordination friction.

3. Baseline economics:
- show reporting labor base and cycle time.

4. Value levers:
- unified portfolio model + automated reporting.

5. Impact:
- translate to days saved and fewer finance cycles.

6. How it works:
- integrate or load key data sources; generate packs.

7. Investment and ROI:
- ROI primarily from reduced reporting effort + decision speed.

8. Proof:
- show cross-asset dashboard and export.

## Pilot and risk reversal

- Scope: one mixed-use site, 60 days
- Timeline: KPI standardization (week 1-2), data consolidation (week 3-4), first pack (week 5-6), measure (week 7-8)
- Success criteria:
  - first automated pack produced within pilot window
  - cycle time down >= 30%

## Do / Don't

- Do: show standardization across asset types.
- Don't: overpromise integration depth before scoping.
