# PropertyX - Data Centers (Segment Spec)

## Segment

- Product: PropertyX
- Segment: Data centers
- Primary buyer: Operations / facilities
- Secondary buyers: Finance, compliance
- Typical environment: high criticality, heavy vendor contracts, strict reporting, uptime and compliance focus

## Positioning

- One-line promise: Governance and cost visibility for critical infrastructure portfolios.
- Status quo: vendor spend visibility limited; reporting manual; governance packs slow.
- Unit heuristic (anchor metric): RM per site per month (vendor OpEx) + reporting cycle days.

## Baseline model (defensible assumptions)

- Base inputs:
  - Sites: 5
  - Vendor OpEx/site/month: RM 800,000
  - Reporting cycle: 18 days
- Formulas:
  - Annual vendor OpEx = sites x OpEx/site/month x 12
- Modeled baseline values:
  - Annual vendor OpEx = 5 x 800,000 x 12 = RM 48.0M

## Impact model

- Primary lever (pick one): vendor governance and spend visibility (0.5-1.5% reduction)
- Secondary lever (pick one): reporting automation
- Result metrics:
  - 1% vendor OpEx reduction modeled = RM 480k/year
  - reporting cycle down 30-60%

## Proof plan (no named claims)

- Operational proof (dashboard): vendor scorecards + budget vs actual.
- Workflow proof: change control approvals.
- Export/report proof: governance pack export.

## Discovery validation (what to measure first)

- What baseline numbers to confirm: vendor spend categories and governance reporting requirements.
- What artifacts the buyer expects to see: compliance/governance pack format.

## Slide-by-slide notes (rewrite Slides 2-8)

2. Problem: governance and reporting must match criticality.
3. Baseline: vendor OpEx base and reporting cycle.
4. Value: scorecards and packs.
5. Impact: small % reduction.
6. How: governance loop.
7. ROI: 1% vendor OpEx + reporting effort.
8. Proof: pack export.

## Pilot and risk reversal

- Scope: one site, top 5 vendors, 60 days
- Timeline: KPI model (week 1-2), data load (week 3-4), first pack (week 5-6), measure (week 7-8)
- Success criteria:
  - vendor KPI coverage >= 90%
  - governance pack generated from system data

## Do / Don't

- Do: keep it about governance and spend.
- Don't: claim uptime improvements.
