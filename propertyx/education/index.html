<!-- ===== 2. THE REALITY ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Reality" data-slug="reality">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>University administrators are cautious buyers — they operate on academic calendars and committee-driven decisions. Don't pitch to the facilities director alone. Lead with: "Your Vice-Chancellor asks for campus performance data. How long does it take to produce?" The 18-day answer is the opening. Frame PropertyX as a governance tool for university leadership, not just an FM system.</p>
    <h4>Key difference for education</h4>
    <p>Education campuses have 3 unique pressures: diverse building types (lecture halls, labs, libraries, residences, sports facilities) with different operational profiles, seasonal usage patterns (semester vs break), and accountability to university leadership and boards of governors who demand transparency. The 3 FTE doing manual reporting is an especially sore point because universities are under budget pressure and those staff could be doing actual facility management.</p>

<!-- ===== 4. VALUE ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="Where PropertyX Creates Value" data-slug="value">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Show the before/after on leadership pack cycle first — "18 days to 7 days" is immediately understood. Then transition to the combined savings: "RM 135K from freed-up reporting staff plus RM 360K from OpEx visibility. Total RM 495K — that's enough to fund a new lab or library renovation." Universities think in terms of what savings can fund.</p>
    <h4>Objection handling</h4>
    <p>"We don't have budget for new systems" — PropertyX saves RM 495K/year and costs RM 180K/year. It funds itself and generates RM 315K surplus. Ask: "What would you do with an extra RM 315K per year?" "Our facilities team isn't tech-savvy" — PropertyX is mobile-first. If your maintenance staff can use WhatsApp, they can use PropertyX. 90%+ adoption within 30 days is the norm because the interface is designed for facilities workers, not IT staff.</p>

<!-- ===== 5. IMPACT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-white" data-title="Impact" data-slug="impact">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Key insight</h4>
    <p>Universities measure campus quality by student and faculty satisfaction — but facilities teams can't improve what they can't measure. When OpEx is visible by building and category, the facilities director can finally answer the VC's question: "Why is the engineering faculty's electricity bill 40% higher than the business school's?" Data-driven facility management is the pitch.</p>
    <h4>What resonates</h4>
    <p>The cycle time card resonates with facilities directors who dread the monthly reporting grind. The OpEx visibility card resonates with university CFOs and bursars who want to know where the money goes. The budget governance card resonates with VCs and boards who want accountability. Tailor to your audience.</p>

        <h3>Cycle Time Reduction</h3>
        <p>A typical Malaysian university campus has 20-40 buildings across academic, residential, sports, and administrative functions. Each building submits performance data separately — often via email or shared drives. The facilities team manually compiles everything into a leadership pack.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before:</strong> 18 days per leadership pack — 5 days collecting data from building managers, 8 days manual Excel compilation, 5 days review and corrections with VCs office</li>
          <li><strong>After:</strong> 7 days — building data flows automatically into standardized campus dashboards and report templates</li>
          <li><strong>Impact:</strong> University leadership gets timely facility performance data. Maintenance issues at lecture halls or labs are flagged in days, not weeks.</li>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>OpEx Visibility</h3>
        <p>Universities typically track OpEx at the department budget level, not by building or category. This means a 40% higher electricity bill at the engineering faculty gets buried in the overall campus utility line. PropertyX breaks down OpEx by building, floor, and category — making waste visible for the first time.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before:</strong> Campus-level OpEx reported as lump sums. No way to compare energy efficiency across buildings or identify which categories are overspending.</li>
          <li><strong>After:</strong> Building-by-building OpEx breakdown — utilities, maintenance, cleaning, security, landscaping — with cross-building benchmarking.</li>
          <li><strong>Impact:</strong> 0.5-1.0% OpEx reduction on RM 72M = RM 360K-720K annually. Most savings come from utilities optimization and maintenance scheduling improvements.</li>

        <h3>Budget Governance</h3>
        <p>University facilities budgets are set annually by the bursar and approved by the board of governors. Once allocated, spending is tracked quarterly at best. Overruns surface too late to course-correct, often requiring emergency supplementary budget requests that embarrass the facilities director in board meetings.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before:</strong> Budget variance reports arrive quarterly. Emergency maintenance (burst pipe, HVAC failure) approved ad hoc with no real-time budget visibility.</li>
          <li><strong>After:</strong> Real-time budget tracking by building and category. Threshold alerts at 80%. Emergency spend requires digital approval with remaining budget shown.</li>
          <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Facilities directors enter board reviews with data-backed explanations. Budget overruns caught 60+ days earlier, reducing supplementary budget requests.</li>

  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Pricing</h4>
    <p>RM 180K/year for a 1.5M sqft campus. Works out to RM 0.01/sqft/month — position against the RM 4.00/sqft they spend on OpEx: "PropertyX costs 0.25% of your OpEx and recovers 0.5%+ in savings plus frees up 1.5 FTE." For multi-campus university groups, offer RM 150K/campus with a 3-campus minimum.</p>
    <h4>Closing technique</h4>
    <p>Universities operate on academic year budgets (usually set by March for the following academic year). Time the pitch for Q4 so it gets into next year's facilities budget. The hook: "Start with one building cluster during the semester break. By the time the new academic year starts, the leadership pack is already automated and the VC has real-time campus data." The 2.75x ROI is strong for education — emphasize the freed-up staff: "Those 1.5 FTE stop compiling reports and start managing facility quality."</p>
