# PropertyX Segment Deck Plan

Use: `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/propertyx/outline.md`

## Objective

Sell PropertyX as the portfolio visibility and control layer:

- reporting cycle time down (immediate win)
- OpEx visibility up
- NOI improvement as a modeled outcome

Anchor unit heuristic:

- RM per sqft per month (OpEx)
- NOI delta

## Segment variants to build

- REIT portfolios
- Mixed-use developers
- Corporate real estate
- Industrial parks
- Education campuses
- Data centers

Segment specs:

- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/propertyx/segments/reit-portfolios.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/propertyx/segments/mixed-use-developers.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/propertyx/segments/corporate-real-estate.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/propertyx/segments/industrial-parks.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/propertyx/segments/education-campuses.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/propertyx/segments/data-centers.md`

## What changes by segment

- Slide 2: owner reporting + governance (REIT) vs consolidation (developers) vs service level + spend control (CRE)
- Slide 3: baseline emphasizes reporting cycle and OpEx/sqft by category
- Slide 8: proof artifacts: owner pack export, OpEx breakdown, vendor scorecards

## Defensible numbers (recommended approach)

- Base: sqft x OpEx/sqft/month
- Savings: small % OpEx reduction (0.5-2%) plus reporting FTE reduction

Keep NOI lift positioned as "modeled" and dependent on execution.

## Evidence artifacts to prepare

- Portfolio KPI dashboard
- OpEx category breakdown with trend
- Owner pack export (monthly)
- Vendor scorecards / budget vs actual

## Pilot offer (recommended)

- Scope: one cluster or one asset class, 60 days
- Success criteria:
  - owner pack cycle time down >= 30%
  - OpEx visibility by category >= 95%
