# AuditX Segment Deck Plan

Use: `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/auditx/outline.md`

## Objective

Sell AuditX as a system that turns audits into a measurable operating cadence:

- cycle time down
- repeat findings down
- evidence exportable on demand

Anchor unit heuristic:

- RM per audit cycle avoided
- RM per finding closed (and aged)

## Segment variants to build

Create separate segment decks later:

- Banking / financial services
- Manufacturing
- Retail / multi-site ops
- Healthcare providers
- Public sector / GLCs
- Logistics / warehousing

Segment specs:

- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/auditx/segments/banking.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/auditx/segments/manufacturing.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/auditx/segments/retail-multi-site.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/auditx/segments/healthcare-providers.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/auditx/segments/public-sector-glcs.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/auditx/segments/logistics-warehousing.md`

## What changes by segment

- Slide 2 (Problem): control testing vs CAPA vs multi-site consistency
- Slide 3 (Baseline): cycle cadence, findings mix, remediation governance
- Slide 4-5 (Value/Impact): choose 1 primary lever:
  - reduce audit cycle duration OR
  - reduce repeat findings OR
  - reduce remediation lag
- Slide 7 (ROI): keep the formula stable; only change inputs
- Slide 8 (Proof): tailor to artifacts the segment expects

## Defensible numbers (recommended approach)

Use a simple model:

- Audit cost per cycle = (auditors x cost/month x months) + overhead
- Savings = avoided ad-hoc audits + rework hours reduced

Keep the "avoided ad-hoc audits" claim conservative (1-2 per year) unless validated.

## Evidence artifacts to prepare

- Findings aging dashboard (owner, SLA, status)
- Evidence attachment + audit trail export
- CAPA / closure workflow with timestamps
- Anonymized before/after: cycle time and repeat findings

## Pilot offer (recommended)

- Scope: 1 audit program, 1-2 sites, 30-60 days
- Success criteria:
  - >= 90% findings have owner + due date within 48 hours
  - cycle time down >= 25% OR repeat findings down >= 30%
