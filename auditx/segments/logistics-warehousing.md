# AuditX - Logistics / Warehousing (Segment Spec)

## Segment

- Product: AuditX
- Segment: Logistics / warehousing
- Primary buyer: Operations director
- Secondary buyers: HSE, quality, internal audit
- Typical environment: SOP compliance, safety checks, multi-site operations, incident reduction focus

## Positioning

- One-line promise: Standardize SOP and safety audits across sites and close findings fast.
- Status quo: paper checklists, photos in chats, inconsistent follow-up.
- Unit heuristic (anchor metric): findings per site per month + closure within 7 days.

## Baseline model (defensible assumptions)

- Base inputs:
  - Sites: 20
  - Audits/site/month: 1
  - Findings/audit: 6
  - Closure within 7 days: 50% baseline
- Formulas:
  - Findings/month = sites x findings
  - Findings closed in 7 days/month = findings/month x closure rate
- Modeled baseline values:
  - Findings/month = 20 x 6 = 120
  - Closed in 7 days/month = 120 x 50% = 60

## Impact model

- Primary lever (pick one): mobile evidence + ownership reduces closure lag
- Secondary lever (pick one): consistent checklists reduce repeat issues
- Result metrics:
  - closure within 7 days up from 50% to 70-85%
  - follow-up effort down 25-40%

## Proof plan (no named claims)

- Operational proof (dashboard): site dashboard with open/overdue findings and aging.
- Workflow proof: evidence capture -> assignment -> closure verification.
- Export/report proof: weekly HSE/ops pack by site.

## Discovery validation (what to measure first)

- What baseline numbers to confirm: audits/month, findings mix, closure SLA, and follow-up effort.
- What artifacts the buyer expects to see: weekly pack format and audit evidence requirements.

## Slide-by-slide notes (rewrite Slides 2-8)

2. Problem: inconsistency across sites creates safety and quality risk.
3. Baseline: findings/month and closure rate.
4. Value: standard checklists + mobile evidence + dashboard.
5. Impact: faster closure and fewer repeats.
6. How: site templates + ops pack.
7. ROI: time saved on follow-up + improved compliance (modeled).
8. Proof: dashboard + export pack.

## Pilot and risk reversal

- Scope: 5 sites, 30 days
- Timeline: setup (week 1), audits (week 2-4), measure + rollout plan (week 5)
- Success criteria:
  - 70%+ findings closed within 7 days
  - 90%+ audits completed on schedule

## Do / Don't

- Do: focus on operational consistency.
- Don't: promise incident reduction without baseline.
