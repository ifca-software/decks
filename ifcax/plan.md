# IFCAx Segment Deck Plan

Use: `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/ifcax/outline.md`

## Objective

Sell IFCAx as control + velocity for finance operations:

- PO/AP cycle cost down
- reconciliation hours down
- month-end close faster

Anchor unit heuristic:

- RM per PO
- days saved on close

## Segment variants to build

- Trading / distribution
- Manufacturing
- Multi-entity groups
- Construction / projects
- Hospitality groups
- Professional services

Segment specs:

- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/ifcax/segments/trading-distribution.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/ifcax/segments/manufacturing.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/ifcax/segments/multi-entity-groups.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/ifcax/segments/construction-projects.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/ifcax/segments/hospitality-groups.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/ifcax/segments/professional-services.md`

## What changes by segment

- Slide 2: PO speed + stock visibility (trading) vs costing + reconciliations (manufacturing) vs controls + consolidation (multi-entity)
- Slide 3: baseline includes PO volume, close days, reconciliation hours
- Slide 8: proof artifacts must include approval matrix, audit trail, real-time aging

## Defensible numbers (recommended approach)

- PO savings = volume x (baseline cost - improved cost)
- Close-time savings = hours reduced (not just days)

Keep labor base explicit (headcount, hourly cost).

## Evidence artifacts to prepare

- Approval matrix + segregation of duties
- AP/AR aging dashboards
- Audit log export
- Close checklist dashboard

## Pilot offer (recommended)

- Scope: AP + PO for one unit, 60 days
- Success criteria:
  - PO cycle time down >= 20%
  - reconciliation hours down >= 15%
