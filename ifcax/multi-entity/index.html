<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Reality" data-slug="reality">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Lead with the consolidation pain. Every group CFO dreads month-end because consolidation is a manual project, not a process. The "8+ entities" number is deliberately flexible -- ask how many entities they have and watch them sigh. Then ask: "How many of those have the same chart of accounts?"</p>
    <h4>Segment-specific positioning</h4>
    <p>Multi-entity groups have a unique pain: the more they grow, the worse their controls get. Every acquisition or new subsidiary adds another system, another approval process, another set of Excel templates. Frame IFCAx as a governance tool, not just an ERP. Ask: "When your external auditors come in, how long does it take to pull a complete audit trail across all entities?"</p>
    <h4>Objection handling</h4>
    <p>"Each entity has its own needs" -- "Absolutely. IFCAx gives each entity its own approval matrix, chart of accounts mapping, and local compliance settings. But group finance gets one consolidated view. Think of it as local control with group visibility."</p>

The breakdown is typically: 3 days waiting for subsidiary submissions, 4 days reconciling inter-company transactions, 3 days performing consolidation eliminations, and 2 days in management review.

    <div class="card metric" data-detail="420 hours represents the combined effort across group finance (6-8 staff) and subsidiary finance teams (1-2 staff per entity x 8 entities). Group finance spends ~200 hrs on consolidation and inter-company elimination. Subsidiary teams collectively spend ~220 hrs preparing submissions, resolving queries, and re-submitting corrected data. The query-resolution loop (group asks subsidiary to explain a variance, subsidiary investigates, re-submits) accounts for 40% of total time.">

At 8+, the number of inter-company transactions, currency translations, and elimination entries makes manual consolidation error-prone and unsustainable. Each new entity added to the group increases consolidation time by approximately 15-20% -- it's not linear, it's exponential because of cross-entity interactions.">

<!-- ===== 4. WHERE IFCAx CREATES VALUE ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="Where IFCAx Creates Value" data-slug="value">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>The three pillars -- one chart of accounts, one approval matrix, one audit trail -- are the value proposition. Walk through each one. For multi-entity groups, the audit trail is often the most compelling because it directly addresses their biggest risk: audit findings and governance gaps.</p>
    <h4>Objection handling</h4>
    <p>"We can't migrate all entities at once" -- "You shouldn't. Start with 2-3 entities -- typically the ones that cause the most consolidation pain. Once those are on IFCAx, the remaining entities can be onboarded in waves. Each wave gets faster because the chart of accounts and approval templates are already configured."</p>
    <p>"Our subsidiaries operate in different countries with different requirements" -- "IFCAx supports multi-currency, multi-tax, and multi-regulatory environments. Each entity gets its own compliance configuration (SST in Malaysia, GST in Singapore, PPN in Indonesia) while group finance sees one consolidated view."</p>
    <h4>Key pivot</h4>
    <p>If the group is publicly listed or PE-backed, pivot to governance. "Bursa Malaysia requires quarterly reporting. If your close takes 12 days, you're spending half of each quarter's reporting window just closing the books. IFCAx cuts that in half."</p>

<!-- ===== 5. IMPACT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-white" data-title="Impact" data-slug="impact">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Key insight</h4>
    <p>The 72 days number is powerful, but for multi-entity groups the audit findings card is the differentiator. External audit fees for a group with control weaknesses can run RM 200K-500K higher per year because auditors spend more time testing compensating controls. One clean audit cycle pays for IFCAx.</p>
    <h4>Conversation steer</h4>
    <p>Ask: "How many audit findings did your group have in the last external audit?" If it's more than 3, there's a clear governance gap. Then ask: "How many of those were related to approval controls or inter-company transaction documentation?" That's where IFCAx eliminates findings entirely.</p>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Group Close Reduction</h3>
        <p>The 30-50% reduction is driven primarily by eliminating the data collection and inter-company reconciliation phases of the close.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Subsidiary submissions (3 days > 0 days):</strong> Eliminated -- all entities transact in the same system; no more waiting for Excel uploads</li>
          <li><strong>Inter-company reconciliation (4 days > 1.5 days):</strong> Auto-matching of inter-company transactions with tolerance rules; mismatches flagged in real time</li>
          <li><strong>Consolidation (3 days > 1.5 days):</strong> Automated elimination entries, currency translation, and minority interest calculations</li>
          <li><strong>Review (2 days > 1.5 days):</strong> Group dashboard shows entity-level P&L and balance sheet in real time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Net result: 12-day close compressed to 5-6 days. For publicly listed groups with quarterly reporting, this means consolidated results available by working day 6 instead of day 12.</p>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Audit Finding Reduction</h3>
        <p>Common audit findings in multi-entity groups stem from inconsistent controls across subsidiaries. IFCAx eliminates the root cause by enforcing uniform policies system-wide.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SoD enforcement:</strong> The same user cannot create and approve a PO, or create and post a journal entry -- enforced across all entities</li>
          <li><strong>Approval trail:</strong> Every transaction carries a complete approval history (who requested, who approved, timestamp, IP address)</li>
          <li><strong>Policy consistency:</strong> Approval limits, expense policies, and vendor onboarding rules applied uniformly across the group</li>
          <li><strong>Audit export:</strong> One-click extraction of audit evidence by entity, date range, transaction type, or user -- no more 3-week data gathering exercises</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Groups typically see audit findings drop from 8-12 per cycle to 2-3, with the remaining findings related to business judgments rather than control weaknesses.</p>
      </template>

    <div class="card" data-detail>

      <p class="text-md text-gray-600">Inter-company eliminations and matching done automatically — not in spreadsheets</p>
      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Inter-Company Reconciliation</h3>
        <p>Inter-company transactions are the single biggest source of consolidation delay. When Entity A bills Entity B, both sides need to record the transaction identically -- and they rarely do.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Auto-matching:</strong> IFCAx matches inter-company invoices to corresponding entries in real time -- mismatches surface immediately, not at month-end</li>
          <li><strong>Elimination entries:</strong> Revenue/cost eliminations, unrealised profit on inter-company inventory, and loan interest eliminations generated automatically</li>
          <li><strong>Currency translation:</strong> Subsidiary results translated to group reporting currency using closing rate (balance sheet) and average rate (P&L) automatically</li>
          <li><strong>Minority interest:</strong> Non-controlling interest calculations automated based on ownership percentages maintained in entity master data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For an 8-entity group with ~200 inter-company transactions per month, automated matching saves approximately 80 hours/month of manual reconciliation.</p>

<!-- ===== 7. THE INVESTMENT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Investment" data-slug="roi">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>For multi-entity groups, anchor on governance value, not just cost savings. Say: "The RM 480K investment isn't just about saving RM 2.1M in finance labor. It's about eliminating audit findings, reducing external audit fees, and giving your board consolidated results 6 days faster. That's a governance decision, not just a cost decision."</p>
    <h4>Pricing guidance</h4>
    <p>RM 480K/year covers up to 8 entities with 50-80 users. For larger groups (10-20 entities), scale to RM 720K-960K. For conglomerates with 20+ entities, custom pricing applies. Always price per entity, not per user -- it aligns with how groups think about their structure.</p>
    <h4>Closing technique</h4>
    <p>For multi-entity groups, the pilot should cover 2-3 entities that have the most inter-company transactions. Say: "Let's start with your three biggest entities -- the ones that cause 80% of your consolidation headaches. In 8 weeks, we'll have them on one system. Your next month-end close will tell you whether to roll out group-wide."</p>

        <h3>ROI Methodology</h3>
        <p>Based on RM 480K/year investment vs RM 2.1M/year in recovered costs for a multi-entity group (8 entities, 60-80 users):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consolidation labor:</strong> RM 680K -- 50% reduction in 420 hrs/month of group reconciliation and consolidation effort</li>
          <li><strong>Close-time compression:</strong> RM 520K -- 6 fewer close days frees group and subsidiary finance teams for analysis and planning</li>
          <li><strong>Audit cost reduction:</strong> RM 350K -- fewer audit findings reduce external audit fees and internal remediation costs</li>
          <li><strong>Control risk mitigation:</strong> RM 550K -- elimination of SoD gaps, unauthorised transactions, and governance exposure across 8 entities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Net: RM 2.1M - RM 480K = RM 1.62M per year. ROI = 2,100 / 480 = <strong>4.4x</strong></p>
