<!-- ===== 2. THE REALITY ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Reality" data-slug="reality">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Lead with the cost overrun problem. Every construction MD has had a project go over budget because finance found out too late. The "30+ active projects" number is the hook -- ask: "Across all your active projects, can you tell me right now which ones are over budget?" If they hesitate, you've found the pain.</p>
    <h4>Segment-specific positioning</h4>
    <p>Construction companies have a unique challenge: project-based accounting with high variation order (VO) volume. Unlike trading or manufacturing, their cost centres are temporary (projects end), their budgets shift constantly (VOs), and their vendor base changes with every project. Frame IFCAx as a project cost control tool, not just an ERP.</p>
    <h4>Objection handling</h4>
    <p>"We use project management software" -- Most construction firms use separate PM tools (Primavera, MS Project) that don't talk to finance. Ask: "Can your project manager see the financial impact of a variation order before it's approved?" That's the gap. IFCAx integrates project budgets with finance so VOs trigger budget re-forecasts automatically.</p>

<!-- ===== 4. WHERE IFCAx CREATES VALUE ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="Where IFCAx Creates Value" data-slug="value">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Walk through the before/after cards. The 12-to-7 day close reduction is realistic for construction (not 50% like manufacturing) because project-based accounting inherently requires more review. The RM 2.1M annual savings includes the cost of late project decisions -- frame it as "money you're currently losing to slow information flow."</p>
    <h4>Objection handling</h4>
    <p>"Our QS team handles project costing" -- "Exactly -- and they do it in their own spreadsheets. The question is: how long does it take for their cost data to reach your finance team? If it's more than 24 hours, you're making financial decisions on stale data."</p>
    <p>"We have too many subcontractors to standardise" -- "IFCAx doesn't standardise your subcontractors -- it standardises your approval process. Every VO, every claim, every payment follows the same approval workflow regardless of which subcontractor or project it's for."</p>
    <h4>Key pivot</h4>
    <p>For construction companies, the VO tracking angle is often the most compelling. Ask: "How many VOs were approved last year that weren't reflected in the project budget?" If the answer is "we don't know," that's the gap IFCAx fills.</p>

<!-- ===== 5. IMPACT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-white" data-title="Impact" data-slug="impact">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Key insight</h4>
    <p>The 60 days number is meaningful, but for construction companies the cost visibility card is the real differentiator. Construction margins are thin (5-12%) and a single untracked VO can wipe out the profit on a project. Frame it as: "Every day you don't have real-time budget vs actual on a RM 50M project, you're flying blind on RM 140K of daily spend."</p>
    <h4>Conversation steer</h4>
    <p>Ask: "On your last 5 completed projects, how many came in within 5% of the original budget?" If the answer is less than 3, the cost visibility gap is costing them real margin. Follow up with: "And how many of those overruns were discovered before the project was 70% complete?"</p>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Project Reconciliation Reduction</h3>
        <p>Construction reconciliation involves matching across three dimensions: project budget, vendor claims/invoices, and progress billing to clients. When these live in separate systems, month-end becomes a cross-referencing exercise.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vendor claim matching:</strong> Subcontractor claims matched to PO/contract values and QS-verified quantities automatically -- 50% of manual verification eliminated</li>
          <li><strong>Progress billing:</strong> Percentage-of-completion calculations linked to actual costs posted against each project -- no more manual Excel models</li>
          <li><strong>Retention tracking:</strong> 5-10% retention on subcontractor payments tracked automatically with release triggers tied to defect liability periods</li>
          <li><strong>VO reconciliation:</strong> Variation orders linked to original contract and reflected in revised budget automatically -- no more budget vs actual discrepancies caused by unrecorded VOs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At 300 hrs/month, a 25% average reduction = 75 hrs saved/month = 900 hrs/year = RM 40,500 in direct labor savings.</p>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Close Time Reduction for Construction</h3>
        <p>Construction close is inherently more complex than other segments because of project-based accounting. The 20-40% range (not 50%) reflects this reality.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data collection (4-5 days > 1 day):</strong> Site QS data, subcontractor claims, and material receipts already in the system -- no more waiting for site submissions</li>
          <li><strong>Reconciliation (4 days > 2.5 days):</strong> Auto-matching handles standard transactions; only genuine exceptions (disputed claims, VO disagreements) need human review</li>
          <li><strong>Review (3 days > 2.5 days):</strong> Project dashboards show real-time budget vs actual by project -- management reviews as data flows in</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For a firm doing 12-day close: realistic target is 7-8 days in year 1, improving to 6 days by year 2 as site teams adopt mobile data entry.</p>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Real-Time Project Cost Visibility</h3>
        <p>This is IFCAx's key differentiator for construction. When project costs post in real time, project managers and finance see budget variances as they happen -- not 12 days after month-end.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Budget vs actual:</strong> Updated with every PO, GRN, and invoice posting -- not just at month-end</li>
          <li><strong>Variance alerts:</strong> Configurable thresholds (e.g., flag when any cost category exceeds 90% of budget) trigger notifications to PM and finance</li>
          <li><strong>VO impact:</strong> Every approved VO automatically updates the project budget forecast -- revised margin calculated in real time</li>
          <li><strong>Cash flow forecasting:</strong> Based on PO commitments, progress billing schedules, and retention release dates -- project-level cash flow visible 3-6 months ahead</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Result: Cost overruns detected 5-10 days earlier on average, enabling corrective action while there's still budget to protect.</p>

<!-- ===== 7. THE INVESTMENT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Investment" data-slug="roi">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>For construction companies, anchor on the cost of one project overrun. Say: "RM 480K per year sounds like a lot until you compare it to one project coming in 3% over budget. On a RM 50M project, that's RM 1.5M in lost margin. IFCAx gives you the visibility to catch that overrun 2 weeks earlier."</p>
    <h4>Pricing guidance</h4>
    <p>RM 480K/year is the standard rate for a mid-size contractor (30-50 active projects, 50-80 users). For smaller builders (10-20 projects), adjust to RM 280K-380K. For Tier 1 contractors with 50+ projects, scale to RM 600K-900K. Always frame the price against the value of one saved project overrun.</p>
    <h4>Closing technique</h4>
    <p>For construction firms, the pilot entry point is AP + project cost tracking for one project group (5-10 projects). Say: "Let's start with your top 10 active projects. In 8 weeks, your PMs will have real-time budget vs actual dashboards. Your first month-end close on IFCAx will prove the value."</p>

        <h3>ROI Methodology</h3>
        <p>Based on RM 480K/year investment vs RM 2.1M/year in recovered costs for a mid-size construction firm (30 active projects, 50-80 users):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reconciliation labor:</strong> RM 162K -- 25% reduction in 3,600 hrs/year of project reconciliation at RM 45/hr</li>
          <li><strong>Close-time compression:</strong> RM 380K -- 5 fewer close days frees finance team for project analysis and cash management</li>
          <li><strong>Cost overrun prevention:</strong> RM 1.1M -- earlier detection of budget variances saves 1-2% on RM 100M+ annual project value</li>
          <li><strong>VO recovery:</strong> RM 458K -- proper VO tracking ensures all approved variations are billed to clients; prevents revenue leakage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Net: RM 2.1M - RM 480K = RM 1.62M per year. ROI = 2,100 / 480 = <strong>4.4x</strong></p>
