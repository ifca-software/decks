# IFCAx - Professional Services (Segment Spec)

## Segment

- Product: IFCAx
- Segment: Professional services
- Primary buyer: Finance controller
- Secondary buyers: Ops, project leads
- Typical environment: billing, project cost tracking, approvals, reporting

## Positioning

- One-line promise: Clean approvals and faster close with clearer receivables and project tracking.
- Status quo: approvals in email, receivables tracked manually.
- Unit heuristic (anchor metric): close days + AR aging.

## Baseline model (defensible assumptions)

- Base inputs:
  - Close time: 12 days
  - Manual reconciliation: 200 hours/month
  - Hourly cost: RM 45
- Formulas:
  - Annual reconciliation cost = hours/month x hourly cost x 12
- Modeled baseline values:
  - Annual reconciliation cost = 200 x 45 x 12 = RM 108,000

## Impact model

- Primary lever (pick one): reduce reconciliation and exceptions
- Secondary lever (pick one): better AR visibility (modeled)
- Result metrics:
  - reconciliation down 15-30%
  - close down 30-50%

## Proof plan (no named claims)

- Operational proof (dashboard): AR aging and cash view.
- Workflow proof: approval audit trail.
- Export/report proof: audit log export.

## Discovery validation (what to measure first)

- What baseline numbers to confirm: reconciliation drivers and AR aging pain.
- What artifacts the buyer expects to see: AR export and close checklist.

## Slide-by-slide notes (rewrite Slides 2-8)

2. Problem: slow close and weak AR visibility.
3. Baseline: hours and close days.
4. Value: dashboards.
5. Impact: time saved.
6. How: approval workflows.
7. ROI: labor savings.
8. Proof: dashboards.

## Pilot and risk reversal

- Scope: one unit AR + approvals, 60 days
- Timeline: setup (week 1-2), go-live (week 3-4), measure (week 5-8)
- Success criteria:
  - reconciliation down >= 15%
  - AR aging reporting automated

## Do / Don't

- Do: keep it measurable.
- Don't: promise billing transformation without scoping.
