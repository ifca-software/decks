# IFCAx - Construction / Projects (Segment Spec)

## Segment

- Product: IFCAx
- Segment: Construction / projects
- Primary buyer: Finance controller
- Secondary buyers: Project management, procurement
- Typical environment: project accounting, approvals, vendor billing, cost control, slow close

## Positioning

- One-line promise: Control project spend with approval traceability and faster close.
- Status quo: project costs in spreadsheets, approvals fragmented, reconciliation heavy.
- Unit heuristic (anchor metric): days saved on close + cost variance visibility.

## Baseline model (defensible assumptions)

- Base inputs:
  - Projects: 30
  - Close time: 12 days
  - Reconciliation effort: 300 hours/month (project-driven)
  - Hourly cost: RM 45
- Formulas:
  - Annual reconciliation cost = hours/month x hourly cost x 12
- Modeled baseline values:
  - Annual reconciliation cost = 300 x 45 x 12 = RM 162,000

## Impact model

- Primary lever (pick one): reduce reconciliation and rework through unified approvals
- Secondary lever (pick one): better project cost visibility reduces variance (modeled)
- Result metrics:
  - reconciliation down 15-30%
  - close time down 20-40%

## Proof plan (no named claims)

- Operational proof (dashboard): project budget vs actual + payables aging.
- Workflow proof: approval matrix and change control.
- Export/report proof: audit log export.

## Discovery validation (what to measure first)

- What baseline numbers to confirm: reconciliation drivers and approval bottlenecks.
- What artifacts the buyer expects to see: project cost reports and audit trail.

## Slide-by-slide notes (rewrite Slides 2-8)

2. Problem: project cost control breaks when approvals are fragmented.
3. Baseline: close days and reconciliation hours.
4. Value: approvals and dashboards.
5. Impact: fewer hours and faster close.
6. How: approval workflow.
7. ROI: time saved.
8. Proof: dashboards and audit logs.

## Pilot and risk reversal

- Scope: one project group, AP + approvals, 60 days
- Timeline: setup (week 1-2), go-live (week 3-4), measure (week 5-8)
- Success criteria:
  - approval coverage 100% for pilot
  - reconciliation hours down >= 15%

## Do / Don't

- Do: keep claims tied to visibility and controls.
- Don't: promise margin improvement without baseline.
