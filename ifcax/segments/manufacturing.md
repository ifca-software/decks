# IFCAx - Manufacturing (Segment Spec)

## Segment

- Product: IFCAx
- Segment: Manufacturing
- Primary buyer: Finance controller
- Secondary buyers: Ops, costing team
- Typical environment: costing accuracy, reconciliations, close pressure

## Positioning

- One-line promise: Close faster with fewer reconciliations and more reliable costing data.
- Status quo: manual reconciliations, costing disputes, slow close.
- Unit heuristic: close days + reconciliation hours.

## Baseline model

- Base inputs:
  - Close time: 12 days
  - Reconciliation effort: 420 hours/month
- Modeled baseline:
  - Annual reconciliation hours = 420 x 12 = 5,040 hours

## Impact model

- Primary lever: reduce reconciliation hours via unified data
- Secondary lever: costing and inventory traceability
- Result metrics:
  - reconciliation down 15-30%
  - close days down 20-50%

## Proof plan

- Operational proof: close checklist + exceptions dashboard.
- Workflow proof: approvals and audit trail.
- Export/report proof: reconciliation and audit log exports.

## Discovery validation (what to measure first)

- Confirm baseline: reconciliation drivers (which accounts) and close bottlenecks by phase.
- Confirm buyer proof bar: costing reports and audit trail requirements.

## Slide notes

2. Problem: close is slow because data is fragmented.
3. Baseline: close days + reconciliation hours.
4. Value: single source of truth.
5. Impact: fewer hours and faster close.
6. How: finance + ops integration.
7. ROI: labor hours reduced.
8. Proof: close checklist dashboard.

## Pilot and risk reversal

- Scope: one plant or one unit, 60 days
- Timeline: setup (week 1-2), go-live (week 3-4), measure (week 5-8)
- Success criteria: reconciliation hours down >= 15%

## Do / Don't

- Do: keep it about close speed and control.
- Don't: promise perfect costing without scoping.
