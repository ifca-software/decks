# IFCAx - Multi-entity Groups (Segment Spec)

## Segment

- Product: IFCAx
- Segment: Multi-entity groups
- Primary buyer: Group finance
- Secondary buyers: Audit, IT
- Typical environment: consolidation, controls, approvals, audit trail

## Positioning

- One-line promise: Faster close with stronger controls and an audit trail that stands up to scrutiny.
- Status quo: spreadsheet consolidation, inconsistent approvals, audit pain.
- Unit heuristic: close days + audit readiness.

## Baseline model

- Base inputs:
  - Entities: 8
  - Close time: 12 days
  - Manual reconciliation: 420 hours/month
- Modeled baseline:
  - close cycles/year: 12

## Impact model

- Primary lever: standardized approvals and audit trails
- Secondary lever: reduced reconciliation
- Result metrics:
  - close down 30-50%
  - exceptions down

## Proof plan

- Operational proof: group close dashboard.
- Workflow proof: segregation of duties in approvals.
- Export/report proof: audit log export.

## Discovery validation (what to measure first)

- Confirm baseline: entity count, consolidation steps, and audit findings tied to approvals.
- Confirm buyer proof bar: segregation-of-duties and audit log evidence.

## Slide notes

2. Problem: consolidation and controls break at scale.
3. Baseline: close days and reconciliation hours.
4. Value: controls + single source.
5. Impact: faster close.
6. How: approvals and audit trails.
7. ROI: labor + risk reduction framed as modeled.
8. Proof: audit trail export.

## Pilot and risk reversal

- Scope: one entity or AP/PO process, 60 days
- Timeline: setup (week 1-2), go-live (week 3-4), measure (week 5-8)
- Success criteria: approval coverage 100%, reconciliation down.

## Do / Don't

- Do: show segregation of duties.
- Don't: promise consolidation without confirming scope.
