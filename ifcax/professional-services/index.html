<!-- ===== 2. THE REALITY ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Reality" data-slug="reality">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Lead with the AR visibility problem. Professional services firms (law, accounting, consulting, engineering) bill millions but often don't know their real receivables position until month-end. The "receivables tracked manually" pain point resonates because partners feel it directly -- late collections affect partner draws and bonuses.</p>
    <h4>Segment-specific positioning</h4>
    <p>Professional services firms are people-businesses with high margins (25-45%) but chronic AR problems. Unlike trading or manufacturing, their biggest cost is staff (60-70% of revenue) and their biggest cash flow challenge is collecting what they've billed. Frame IFCAx as a receivables and profitability tool. Ask: "What percentage of your billings are collected within 60 days?" If it's below 80%, there's a significant cash gap.</p>
    <h4>Objection handling</h4>
    <p>"We use practice management software" -- "IFCAx doesn't replace your practice management system. It integrates with it. Your practice management handles time tracking and matter management; IFCAx handles billing, AP, GL, and reporting. The gap is usually between 'time recorded' and 'cash collected' -- that's where receivables fall through the cracks."</p>

    <div class="card metric" data-detail="200 hours = approximately 7 finance staff x 3 hours/day x 10 working days. Professional services firms have smaller finance teams than manufacturers but their reconciliation is equally complex due to: client-matter level tracking (thousands of active matters), partner-level profitability calculations, trust account reconciliation (for law firms), and expense disbursement matching. The WIP-to-billing reconciliation alone consumes 40% of this effort.">

Every 10-day improvement in DSO on RM 30M annual billings frees up approximately RM 820K in working capital.

<!-- ===== 4. WHERE IFCAx CREATES VALUE ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="Where IFCAx Creates Value" data-slug="value">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Walk through the before/after cards. The 12-to-6 day close reduction frees the finance team, but for professional services firms the real value is in AR visibility. Let the RM 2.1M savings number land, then pivot: "The savings number includes the value of faster collections. For a firm billing RM 30M a year, a 10-day DSO improvement frees up RM 820K in cash that's currently stuck in receivables."</p>
    <h4>Objection handling</h4>
    <p>"Our partners manage their own collections" -- "That's the problem. Partners are focused on client work, not chasing invoices. IFCAx sends automated aging alerts to partners when their clients' invoices hit 30, 60, 90 days overdue. The partner gets a nudge; the client gets a professional reminder. Collections improve without partners spending time on administration."</p>
    <p>"We bill on completion, not monthly" -- "Even for milestone billing, IFCAx tracks WIP in real time so partners know their unbilled exposure at any moment. And for firms that do monthly billing, automated invoice generation from time records eliminates the billing backlog that causes late collection."</p>
    <h4>Key pivot</h4>
    <p>For professional services firms, engagement-level profitability is the differentiator. Ask: "Do you know which clients are profitable and which are loss-makers?" Most firms can answer for their top 5 clients but not for the next 50. IFCAx tracks profit by engagement, partner, and practice area in real time.</p>

<!-- ===== 5. IMPACT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-white" data-title="Impact" data-slug="impact">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Key insight</h4>
    <p>The 72 days number lands with managing partners who feel the close is too slow. But for professional services, the AR visibility card is the killer. Late collections are the #1 cash flow problem for law firms, accounting firms, and consultancies. Frame it as: "Your partners billed RM 30M last year. How much of that is still sitting in receivables right now? And how quickly did your team flag the overdue ones?" If the answer is "at month-end," that's 30 days of delayed collection action.</p>
    <h4>Conversation steer</h4>
    <p>Ask: "What's your firm's realisation rate?" (Billings collected as a percentage of time recorded.) Industry average is 85-90%. If theirs is below 90%, every 1% improvement on RM 30M billings = RM 300K in additional revenue. IFCAx doesn't directly improve realisation, but real-time WIP visibility lets partners make write-off decisions faster and bill before the work gets stale.</p>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Reconciliation Reduction for Professional Services</h3>
        <p>Professional services reconciliation involves matching across four dimensions: time records, billing, collections, and WIP. When these live in separate systems (practice management, billing software, accounting package, Excel), month-end becomes a cross-referencing marathon.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>WIP reconciliation:</strong> Automated calculation of unbilled time and disbursements by engagement; write-off approvals tracked in-system</li>
          <li><strong>Billing-to-GL:</strong> Invoices generated from time records auto-post to AR and revenue in GL -- no manual journal entries</li>
          <li><strong>Payment matching:</strong> Client payments auto-matched to outstanding invoices using reference numbers; unmatched payments flagged for review</li>
          <li><strong>Trust account (law firms):</strong> Automated trust-to-office transfer reconciliation with compliance alerts for trust account rules</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At 200 hrs/month, a 25% reduction = 50 hrs saved/month = 600 hrs/year = RM 27,000 in direct labor savings.</p>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Close Time Reduction for Professional Services</h3>
        <p>The 30-50% reduction is driven by eliminating the data-gathering and WIP reconciliation phases of the close.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Time record collection (3 days > 0.5 days):</strong> Time entries already in the system from daily capture; automated reminders for missing time sheets</li>
          <li><strong>WIP reconciliation (4 days > 1.5 days):</strong> Real-time WIP dashboard shows unbilled time by partner, practice area, and client; write-off decisions made in-system</li>
          <li><strong>AR reconciliation (3 days > 1.5 days):</strong> Auto-matching handles 80% of payment allocations; only complex allocations (partial payments, disputed invoices) need human review</li>
          <li><strong>Partner review (2 days > 1.5 days):</strong> Partners review their client profitability and AR aging in real-time dashboards, not in end-of-month reports</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Net: 12-day close compressed to 5-6 days. Partners get monthly financials a week earlier, enabling faster billing decisions and collection follow-up.</p>
      </template>
    </div>
    <div class="card" data-detail>
      <h3 class="text-navy">AR visibility</h3>
      <p class="text-md text-gray-600">Real-time aging dashboards — overdue invoices flagged automatically, not discovered days later</p>
      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>AR Visibility for Professional Services</h3>
        <p>Receivables management is the #1 cash flow lever for professional services firms. Late collections directly impact partner distributions and working capital.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Real-time aging:</strong> AR aging by client, partner, practice area, and invoice age -- updated with every payment posting, not just at month-end</li>
          <li><strong>Automated alerts:</strong> Partners receive notifications when their client invoices hit 30, 60, 90 days overdue -- prompting timely follow-up</li>
          <li><strong>Collection forecasting:</strong> Based on historical payment patterns by client -- predict which invoices are at risk of going beyond 90 days</li>
          <li><strong>DSO tracking:</strong> Days sales outstanding by partner and practice area -- identify which parts of the firm have collection problems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Result: 10-day average DSO improvement. On RM 30M annual billings, that frees up RM 820K in working capital and reduces bad debt write-offs by 15-25%.</p>

<!-- ===== 7. THE INVESTMENT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Investment" data-slug="roi">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>For professional services firms, anchor on the DSO improvement value. Say: "RM 480K per year is less than 2% of a mid-size firm's revenue. But a 10-day improvement in DSO on RM 30M billings frees up RM 820K in cash that's currently stuck in receivables. The system pays for itself through faster collections alone -- everything else is upside."</p>
    <h4>Pricing guidance</h4>
    <p>RM 480K/year covers a mid-size firm (50-100 professionals, 20-30 finance/admin users). For smaller firms (20-30 professionals), adjust to RM 200K-280K. For large firms (200+ professionals), scale to RM 600K-800K. For law firms, add RM 60K for trust accounting module. Position against Thomson Reuters Elite (RM 1.5M+) and Aderant (RM 1.2M+) -- IFCAx delivers core financial management at 30% of the cost.</p>
    <h4>Closing technique</h4>
    <p>For professional services firms, the pilot entry point is AR + billing for one practice area or department. Say: "Let's start with your largest practice area. In 8 weeks, your partners will have real-time AR aging dashboards and your finance team will close that practice area 50% faster. Then we extend to the rest of the firm."</p>

        <p>Based on RM 480K/year investment vs RM 2.1M/year in recovered costs for a mid-size professional services firm (50-100 professionals, RM 30M annual billings):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reconciliation labor:</strong> RM 108K -- 25% reduction in 2,400 hrs/year of reconciliation effort at RM 45/hr</li>
