<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Reality" data-slug="reality">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Lead with the costing gap. Every manufacturing CFO has been burned by a margin surprise -- a product they thought was profitable turning out to be a loss-maker because BOM costs weren't feeding into finance. The 420 hours/month number is the hook: "That's your entire finance team spending half their month just reconciling."</p>
    <h4>Segment-specific positioning</h4>
    <p>Manufacturers care about two things: accurate product costing and fast close. Unlike trading companies, their cost structure is complex (raw materials, WIP, finished goods, overhead allocation). Frame IFCAx as a costing accuracy tool, not just an ERP. Ask: "When was the last time your actual production cost matched your standard cost within 5%?"</p>
    <h4>Objection handling</h4>
    <p>"We have an MRP system" -- Most Malaysian manufacturers have a standalone MRP or production planning tool that doesn't talk to finance. Ask: "Can your production team see the financial impact of a BOM change before they make it?" That's the gap IFCAx fills.</p>

<!-- ===== 4. WHERE IFCAx CREATES VALUE ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="Where IFCAx Creates Value" data-slug="value">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Walk through the before/after cards slowly. The 12-to-6 day close reduction is the anchor. Then let the RM 2.1M savings number land. For manufacturers, this is about freeing up finance staff to do analysis instead of data entry.</p>
    <h4>Objection handling</h4>
    <p>"Our close is already at 8 days" -- Congratulate them, then pivot: "Great -- but how much of your finance team's time during those 8 days is spent on manual reconciliation versus analysis? IFCAx doesn't just compress the days -- it changes what your team does during those days."</p>
    <p>"BOM costing is our production team's problem, not finance" -- "It becomes finance's problem when the margin report is wrong. If BOM data doesn't flow into your GL automatically, someone is re-keying it -- and that's where errors creep in."</p>
    <h4>Key pivot</h4>
    <p>For manufacturers, the costing accuracy angle is often more compelling than the close-time reduction. Ask: "What's your variance between standard cost and actual cost on your top 5 products?" If they can't answer quickly, that's the gap.</p>

<!-- ===== 5. IMPACT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-white" data-title="Impact" data-slug="impact">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Key insight</h4>
    <p>The 72 days number is the one that lands hardest with CEOs and MDs. Frame it as: "Your management team currently makes decisions based on financial data that's 12 days old at best. With IFCAx, that lag drops to 6 days -- and for operational metrics, it's real-time. That's 72 extra days per year of timely decision-making."</p>
    <h4>Conversation steer</h4>
    <p>For manufacturers, the costing accuracy card is the most differentiated. Most ERP pitches focus on close time. IFCAx's edge is the BOM-to-GL integration -- ask: "How do you currently get your production cost data into your financial statements?" If the answer involves Excel, you've found the pain point.</p>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Reconciliation Reduction</h3>
        <p>The 15-30% reduction range depends on current system landscape. Manufacturers running 3+ disconnected systems (production planning, inventory, accounting) see the higher end; those already on a partial ERP see 15-20%.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AP reconciliation:</strong> Auto-matching of supplier invoices to GRNs and POs eliminates 40-60% of manual AP work</li>
          <li><strong>Inventory reconciliation:</strong> Real-time stock movements posting to GL reduces month-end physical vs system count discrepancies by 50%</li>
          <li><strong>WIP valuation:</strong> Automated overhead allocation based on production order completion eliminates manual journal entries</li>
          <li><strong>Inter-department charges:</strong> Automated cost centre allocation removes 100% of manual inter-department reconciliation</li>
        </ul>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Close Time Reduction</h3>
        <p>The 20-50% range reflects the maturity of current processes. Manufacturers still on fully manual processes (Excel-based consolidation) see 50% reduction; those with partial automation see 20-30%.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data collection phase (4 days > 0.5 days):</strong> Eliminated -- all production, inventory, and financial data already in one system</li>
          <li><strong>Reconciliation phase (5 days > 2-3 days):</strong> Auto-matching handles 60-80% of line items; only genuine exceptions need human review</li>
          <li><strong>Review phase (3 days > 2 days):</strong> Real-time dashboards let management review as data flows in, not after</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For a manufacturer doing 12-day close: realistic target is 6-7 days in year 1, with potential to reach 4-5 days by year 2 as staff master the system.</p>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Costing Accuracy Improvement</h3>
        <p>BOM-to-GL integration is IFCAx's key differentiator for manufacturers. When production costs flow directly into financial reporting, costing disputes between production and finance disappear.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Standard vs actual variance:</strong> Tracked automatically per production order -- no more end-of-month surprises</li>
          <li><strong>Material cost:</strong> Purchase price variance posted at GRN, not discovered during close</li>
          <li><strong>Labor and overhead:</strong> Allocated automatically based on production order hours and machine utilisation</li>
          <li><strong>Scrap and rework:</strong> Captured at source and posted to cost of goods, not buried in general overhead</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Result: Product-level margin accuracy improves from +/-15% to +/-3%, enabling pricing decisions based on real data rather than estimates.</p>

<!-- ===== 7. THE INVESTMENT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Investment" data-slug="roi">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Let the 4.4x ROI number sit. Then say: "At RM 480K per year, you're investing RM 40K per month. Your finance team currently spends RM 190K per month on reconciliation labor alone. Even a 25% reduction in that effort pays for the system."</p>
    <h4>Pricing guidance</h4>
    <p>RM 480K/year is the standard rate for a mid-size manufacturer (50-100 users). For SME manufacturers (20-40 users), adjust to RM 280K-380K. For large manufacturers with multiple plants, scale to RM 600K-900K. Position against SAP B1 (RM 800K-1.2M) and Oracle (RM 1.5M+) -- IFCAx delivers 80% of the functionality at 40% of the cost.</p>
    <h4>Closing technique</h4>
    <p>For manufacturers, the pilot entry point is always finance + procurement for one plant. Don't try to sell the full suite upfront. Say: "Let's start with AP and inventory for your main plant. In 8 weeks, you'll see the reconciliation hours drop. Then we add BOM costing and production order tracking."</p>

        <p>Based on RM 480K/year investment vs RM 2.1M/year in recovered costs for a mid-size manufacturer (RM 100-300M revenue, 50-100 users, single plant):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reconciliation labor:</strong> RM 570K -- 25% reduction in 5,040 hrs/year of reconciliation effort at RM 45/hr average</li>
          <li><strong>Close-time compression:</strong> RM 680K -- 6 fewer close days frees 14 finance staff for 6 days/month of productive work</li>
          <li><strong>Costing accuracy:</strong> RM 450K -- elimination of margin surprises; better pricing decisions on RM 150M+ revenue base</li>
          <li><strong>Working capital:</strong> RM 400K -- 3-day improvement in inventory turns and 5-day DSO improvement on RM 80M receivables</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Net: RM 2.1M - RM 480K = RM 1.62M per year. ROI = 2,100 / 480 = <strong>4.4x</strong></p>
