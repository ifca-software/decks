# FMX-SME Segment Deck Plan

Use: `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/fmx-sme/outline.md`

## Objective

Sell FMX-SME as fast-to-value maintenance discipline:

- downtime down
- emergency call-outs down
- response time down

Anchor unit heuristic:

- RM per downtime hour avoided
- RM per site per month

## Segment variants to build

- Clinics
- F&B outlets
- Warehouses
- Schools / education
- Gyms / clubs
- Retail chain outlets

Segment specs:

- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/fmx-sme/segments/clinics.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/fmx-sme/segments/fnb-outlets.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/fmx-sme/segments/warehouses.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/fmx-sme/segments/schools-education.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/fmx-sme/segments/gyms-clubs.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/fmx-sme/segments/retail-chain-outlets.md`

## What changes by segment

- Slide 2: compliance and critical assets (clinics) vs refrigeration uptime (F&B) vs equipment uptime (warehouses)
- Slide 3: baseline measured as downtime hours and emergency call-outs
- Slide 8: proof artifacts: PM compliance, work order audit trail, response time dashboard

## Defensible numbers (recommended approach)

- Downtime savings = hours avoided x RM impact/hour
- Call-out savings = (baseline call-outs - new call-outs) x RM per call-out

Keep RM impact/hour conservative; offer a range and select a midpoint for modeling.

## Evidence artifacts to prepare

- Asset list + PM schedules
- Work order workflow and timestamps
- Response time dashboard
- Vendor performance view

## Pilot offer (recommended)

- Scope: one site, 30 days
- Success criteria:
  - PM compliance >= 70%
  - emergency call-outs down >= 20%
