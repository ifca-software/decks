<!-- ===== 2. THE REALITY ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Reality" data-slug="reality">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Retail chain operators think in multi-site terms. The pain isn't "one outlet has a problem" — it's "I have no visibility across 30 outlets." Lead with the HQ visibility angle: "Right now, your outlet managers each handle maintenance their own way. You have no idea which outlets have the most breakdowns, which vendors are fastest, or where you're overspending. FMX gives you a single dashboard for all 30 locations." For chains with DCs/warehouses, extend: "And your warehouse dock doors, forklifts, and cold rooms have their own PM schedules — all in the same dashboard."</p>
    <h4>Key difference for retail</h4>
    <p>Retail chains have a unique scaling problem: each new outlet multiplies the maintenance chaos. The person who opened 5 outlets with WhatsApp management can't scale to 30 the same way. FMX is the process that scales — same PM schedule template deployed to every outlet automatically. Also, retail has brand consistency requirements: a broken sign or flickering light in one outlet damages the entire brand.</p>
    <h4>Warehouse angle</h4>
    <p>Many retail chains operate their own distribution centres or logistics hubs. Warehouse maintenance is even more critical than retail — a failed dock door or forklift stops the entire supply chain. Cold chain compliance failures can destroy inventory worth tens of thousands. Position FMX as the single platform that covers both storefront and back-end operations.</p>

<!-- ===== 4. WHERE FMX CREATES VALUE ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="Where FMX Creates Value" data-slug="value">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Walk through the chain-wide multiplication. Retail operators immediately grasp "1 call-out per outlet per month x 30 outlets = 30 call-outs." Then show the reduction: "FMX cuts that by 30% = 9 fewer call-outs = RM 3,600/month saved — just from emergency premiums, before counting vendor cost standardization." For warehouse-heavy prospects, pivot to equipment uptime: "One dock door out of service for a shift costs more than a month of FMX."</p>
    <h4>Objection handling</h4>
    <p>"Our outlet managers won't adopt a new system" — That's why FMX uses the same workflow they already know: take a photo, describe the issue, submit. The difference is it goes to a central dashboard instead of a WhatsApp group. Most outlet managers prefer it because they get faster vendor response and don't have to chase anyone. Adoption is typically 80%+ within 2 weeks because it's easier than the current process.</p>
    <h4>Warehouse angle</h4>
    <p>"Our warehouse team uses spreadsheets for forklift PM" — FMX automates forklift servicing schedules by hour-meter or calendar, with photo checklists for pre-shift inspections. Dock door and cold room PM schedules are templated. Safety compliance records are audit-ready, not buried in a spreadsheet.</p>

FMX deploys standardized PM schedules across all outlets and warehouses — air-con servicing, signage checks, forklift PM, dock door maintenance, cold room inspections. This reduces chain-wide call-outs by ~30% (30 → 21), saving RM 3,600/month in outlet premiums plus RM 1,500+ in warehouse equipment downtime. Additional savings come from vendor cost standardization and cold chain compliance: benchmarking vendor pricing across sites eliminates the 15–20% cost variance where the same repair costs different amounts at different locations.">

<!-- ===== 5. IMPACT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-white" data-title="Impact" data-slug="impact">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Key insight</h4>
    <p>For retail chains, the most compelling metric isn't the per-outlet savings (RM 120/outlet/month is modest) — it's the HQ visibility and vendor standardization story. Ask: "Do you know right now which of your 30 outlets had the most breakdowns last month? Which vendor was slowest? Where you spent the most on repairs?" The answer is always "no." That's the hook — FMX makes the invisible visible, and visibility drives accountability.</p>
    <h4>Warehouse hook</h4>
    <p>For chains with DCs, add: "How many forklift breakdowns did your warehouse have last month? How many hours of cold storage alarm downtime? Are your dock doors on a PM schedule or break-fix?" These questions reveal that warehousing operations are even more opaque than retail — and the cost of equipment downtime is higher because it affects the entire supply chain.</p>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Fewer Call-outs</h3>
        <p>Retail outlets have a standard set of assets that fail predictably: air-con units, signage lighting, electrical panels, and plumbing. Warehouses add dock doors, forklifts, conveyor systems, and cold storage units. Without PM schedules, each site handles maintenance reactively — waiting for equipment to fail before calling a vendor.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before:</strong> ~1 emergency call-out per outlet per month at RM 400 premium = RM 12,000/month for a 30-outlet chain, plus unscheduled warehouse equipment downtime</li>
          <li><strong>After:</strong> ~0.7 call-outs per outlet per month with standardized PM schedules deployed chain-wide; forklift and dock door PM reduces unplanned warehouse downtime</li>
          <li><strong>Impact:</strong> 9 fewer call-outs per month across the chain = RM 3,600 in avoided emergency premiums, plus reduced store disruption during trading hours and fewer supply chain interruptions at DCs</li>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Faster Response</h3>
        <p>When an air-con fails at a retail outlet during a Saturday afternoon rush, the outlet manager WhatsApps their personal contact for a vendor. When a dock door jams at a DC during peak receiving, the warehouse supervisor calls whoever picks up. FMX standardizes vendor dispatch across all outlets and warehouses.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before:</strong> Average 4–8 hours from report to vendor arrival, with no tracking or escalation</li>
          <li><strong>After:</strong> Average 2–4 hours with central dispatch, pre-assigned vendors per region, and automatic SLA escalation</li>
          <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Faster resolution means less disruption during trading hours and fewer supply chain delays — critical for both mall lease compliance and warehouse throughput targets</li>

        <h3>HQ Visibility</h3>
        <p>Retail HQ teams currently rely on outlet managers to report maintenance issues — which means they only hear about problems when they escalate. Warehouse operations are even more siloed, with forklift logs and cold room checks on paper or spreadsheets. FMX gives HQ a real-time dashboard across all outlets and DCs without any manual reporting.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before:</strong> Zero HQ visibility into outlet and warehouse maintenance — no data on call-out frequency, equipment uptime, vendor performance, or repair costs per site</li>
          <li><strong>After:</strong> Live dashboard showing every outlet's and DC's open work orders, response times, vendor scorecards, equipment status, and monthly spend</li>
          <li><strong>Impact:</strong> HQ can identify problem sites (high call-out frequency), underperforming vendors (slow response), equipment nearing end-of-life, and cost outliers — enabling data-driven decisions instead of reactive management</li>
        </ul>

<!-- ===== 7. THE INVESTMENT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Investment" data-slug="roi" data-roi='{"unit":"outlets","base":30}'>
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Pricing</h4>
    <p>RM 350/outlet/month is the standard rate. For chains with 20+ outlets, negotiate to RM 250/outlet. For 50+ outlets, RM 200/outlet. Warehouses/DCs priced at RM 500–800/site depending on equipment count and cold storage. Retail chains negotiate hard on per-unit pricing — be prepared to show the chain-wide value: "At RM 250/outlet x 30 outlets + 3 DCs at RM 600 each, you invest RM 9,300/month to save RM 5,000+ in call-outs and equipment downtime, plus vendor cost standardization and HQ visibility you can't put a price on."</p>
    <h4>Closing technique</h4>
    <p>Retail chains have ops managers who make decisions quickly when they see data. Offer: "Start with your 10 highest-maintenance outlets and one DC. Deploy standardized PM schedules and the HQ dashboard in one week. After 30 days, I'll show you a comparison report: call-out frequency, response time, equipment uptime, and vendor spend — FMX sites vs non-FMX sites. The data will make the rollout decision for you."</p>
