<!-- ===== 2. THE REALITY ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Reality" data-slug="reality">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>School administrators and education group CEOs care about two things: student/parent experience and budget predictability. Don't lead with "maintenance efficiency" — lead with "no more disrupted classes." Say: "When the air-con fails during exams or the lift breaks in a 5-storey building, it's not a maintenance issue — it's an education issue. Parents notice. Enrolment decisions are affected."</p>
    <h4>Government angle</h4>
    <p>For government prospects, lead with accountability and audit readiness. Government building managers answer to the Auditor General and parliamentary committees. Say: "When the AG's office audits your maintenance spend, can you show a complete asset register, work order history, and cost breakdown? FMX gives you that automatically." Government pain points: aging infrastructure with deferred maintenance backlogs, political pressure to demonstrate prudent spending, and compliance requirements under MCCG and public asset management standards.</p>
    <h4>Key difference for schools</h4>
    <p>Schools have two unique dynamics: (1) fixed budget cycles — maintenance budgets are set annually and overruns require board approval, so budget predictability matters more than absolute savings, and (2) safety and compliance are non-negotiable — fire safety (BOMBA), elevator inspections (JKKP), and building certificates affect operating licences. A school that fails a safety audit can face closure orders. Frame FMX as "compliance insurance" as much as cost savings.</p>

<!-- ===== 4. WHERE FMX CREATES VALUE ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="Where FMX Creates Value" data-slug="value">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Walk through the cost breakdown carefully — school administrators need to justify every ringgit to their board. Emphasize budget predictability: "Instead of surprise RM 2,400 emergency bills, you'll have a predictable RM 350/month subscription that actually reduces your total spend. Your finance team will thank you."</p>
    <h4>Objection handling</h4>
    <p>"Our maintenance budget is already tight — we can't add another cost." — FMX doesn't add cost, it redirects it. You're already spending RM 4,320/month on reactive maintenance. FMX shifts RM 1,380 of that into planned work, and gives you RM 1,030/month net savings. Show them it's a budget reduction, not a budget increase.</p>
    <h4>Government-specific framing</h4>
    <p>For government agencies and GLCs: emphasize taxpayer accountability and audit readiness. "Every ringgit spent on maintenance is public money — the Auditor General expects a full trail. FMX provides that automatically, plus helps you demonstrate that preventive maintenance is reducing your total cost of ownership. That's a story your KSU and PAC want to hear."</p>

<!-- ===== 5. IMPACT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-white" data-title="Impact" data-slug="impact">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Key insight</h4>
    <p>For schools, the compliance and safety angle often resonates more than cost savings. Private schools and international schools face BOMBA fire safety inspections, JKKP lift inspections, and building certificate renewals. A failed inspection can mean closure orders or delayed licence renewal. Ask: "Can you show your BOMBA inspector a complete fire system maintenance log right now?" Most can't. FMX generates that documentation automatically — that's worth more than the RM 1,380/month in direct savings.</p>
    <h4>Government compliance angle</h4>
    <p>Government buildings face similar compliance pressures plus Auditor General scrutiny, MCCG requirements for GLCs, and public asset management standards. Ask: "When the AG's office requests your maintenance spend breakdown by building and asset class, how long does it take to produce?" For most government agencies the answer is weeks of manual compilation. FMX generates it instantly. This alone justifies the investment in government procurement terms.</p>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Fewer Emergencies</h3>
        <p>Campuses and government buildings share a predictable set of failure points: air-con units in classrooms and office floors (high usage in Malaysian heat), electrical panels serving labs, IT rooms, and public counters, plumbing across toilet blocks, and fire/safety systems. Without PM schedules, these become emergencies during operating hours.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before:</strong> 6 emergency call-outs per month at RM 400 each = RM 2,400/month — most occur during school hours or public service hours, disrupting classes and citizen services</li>
          <li><strong>After:</strong> ~4 call-outs per month with PM schedules catching filter blockages, wiring issues, and pump failures before they escalate</li>
          <li><strong>Impact:</strong> RM 800/month saved in premiums, plus significantly fewer disruptions — air-con issues alone account for 40% of institutional maintenance emergencies</li>

      <template data-detail-content>
        <h3>Faster Response</h3>
        <p>When a classroom air-con fails during morning assembly or a government counter's electrical panel trips, the current process is manual: someone informs the office, the office calls admin, admin calls a vendor. By the time the vendor arrives, students or citizens have been waiting for hours. FMX dispatches instantly.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before:</strong> Average 6–10 hours from report to vendor arrival — often next-day during exam periods or peak service hours</li>
          <li><strong>After:</strong> Average 2–4 hours with mobile dispatch, pre-assigned vendors, and automatic escalation for critical assets</li>
          <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Classrooms, labs, and public service areas restored to working conditions within the same day — protecting learning outcomes, parent satisfaction, and public service delivery</li>

        <h3>Budget Predictability</h3>
        <p>School maintenance budgets are set annually by the board. Government maintenance budgets go through parliamentary appropriation.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before:</strong> No visibility into maintenance spend until invoices arrive — budget overruns discovered at quarter-end or during AG audits</li>
          <li><strong>After:</strong> Real-time spend tracking with monthly reports showing cost per asset category, vendor spend breakdown, and budget utilization — ready for board presentations or Auditor General reviews</li>
          <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Finance teams can forecast maintenance spend accurately, avoiding the "surprise RM 10,000 air-con replacement" that derails annual budgets. Government agencies get audit-ready documentation that demonstrates prudent spending of public funds</li>

<!-- ===== 7. THE INVESTMENT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Investment" data-slug="roi" data-roi='{"unit":"campuses","base":5}'>
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Pricing</h4>
    <p>RM 350/site/month is the standard rate. For education groups with 3+ campuses, offer RM 300/site. Schools are budget-sensitive — always frame against existing spend: "You're already spending RM 4,320/month on reactive maintenance. FMX is RM 350/month and reduces that by RM 1,380. Net effect: your maintenance budget drops by RM 1,030/month while getting better results."</p>
    <h4>Closing technique — education</h4>
    <p>School decisions go through boards and take 1–2 budget cycles. Start the conversation in Q3 (Jul–Sep) for the next academic year budget. Offer a term-long pilot: "Deploy on one campus for one school term. We'll give the board a report showing PM compliance, call-out reduction, and cost impact. That report becomes your business case for group-wide rollout." This aligns with how schools make decisions — per-term, with board approval.</p>
    <h4>Closing technique — government</h4>
    <p>Government procurement follows annual budget cycles and requires justification papers. Start in Q3 (Jul–Sep) for next year's operating budget submission. Offer a proof-of-concept on one building: "Deploy on your headquarters building for 3 months. We'll produce a report showing PM compliance, cost savings, and audit-ready documentation. That report becomes your justification paper for ministry-wide rollout." Government buyers need documented evidence — give them a pilot that generates the paperwork they need.</p>

        <p>Payback period: RM 350 / RM 1,380 = <strong>7.6 days</strong> — the system pays for itself in just over a week.</p>
        <p>For a 5-campus education group or 5-building government agency: RM 1,030 net savings x 5 = RM 5,150/month or <strong>RM 61,800/year</strong>. This doesn't include the compliance value — automated audit trails for BOMBA, JKKP, building certificate inspections, Auditor General requirements, and MCCG standards eliminate the risk of licence issues or adverse audit findings that could cost far more.</p>
