# FMX - Schools / Education (Segment Spec)

## Segment

- Product: FMX
- Segment: Schools / education
- Primary buyer: Facilities manager / operations
- Secondary buyers: Finance, administrators
- Typical environment: limited maintenance staff, safety checks, recurring PM needs

## Positioning

- One-line promise: Prevent small issues from becoming costly closures with preventive schedules and fast response.
- Status quo: reactive fixes, no visibility, vendor costs inconsistent.
- Unit heuristic (anchor metric): downtime hours avoided + emergency call-outs.

## Baseline model (defensible assumptions)

- Base inputs:
  - Unplanned downtime: 16 hours/month (facilities disruptions)
  - Cost impact/hour: RM 120 (conservative)
  - Emergency call-outs: 6/month
  - Premium per call-out: RM 400
- Formulas:
  - Downtime cost/month = hours x RM/hour
  - Emergency premium/month = call-outs x premium
- Modeled baseline values:
  - Downtime cost/month = 16 x 120 = RM 1,920
  - Emergency premium/month = 6 x 400 = RM 2,400

## Impact model

- Primary lever (pick one): increase PM compliance to reduce emergency call-outs
- Secondary lever (pick one): faster response time via work orders
- Result metrics:
  - emergency call-outs down 20-40%
  - response time down 30-50%

## Proof plan (no named claims)

- Operational proof (dashboard): PM compliance and response time dashboard.
- Workflow proof: work order timestamps.
- Export/report proof: monthly maintenance summary.

## Discovery validation (what to measure first)

- What baseline numbers to confirm: call-outs/month and average response time.
- What artifacts the buyer expects to see: monthly reporting format.

## Slide-by-slide notes (rewrite Slides 2-8)

2. Problem: reactive maintenance disrupts operations.
3. Baseline: call-outs and downtime.
4. Value: PM schedules.
5. Impact: fewer emergencies.
6. How: mobile work orders.
7. ROI: avoided premiums.
8. Proof: dashboards and exports.

## Pilot and risk reversal

- Scope: one campus/site, 30 days
- Timeline: setup week 1, go-live week 2, measure weeks 3-4
- Success criteria:
  - PM compliance >= 70%
  - emergency call-outs down >= 20%

## Do / Don't

- Do: keep it about reliability and compliance checks.
- Don't: promise capex avoidance.
