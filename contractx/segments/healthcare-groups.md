# ContractX - Healthcare Groups (Segment Spec)

## Segment

- Product: ContractX
- Segment: Healthcare groups
- Primary buyer: Procurement head
- Secondary buyers: Clinical engineering, Legal, Finance
- Typical environment: OEM service contracts, consumables contracts, multiple sites, high SLA criticality

## Positioning

- One-line promise: Control OEM contracts and service SLAs so uptime is not dependent on spreadsheets.
- Status quo: contract overlaps, unclear SLA tiers, renewals missed, proof scattered.
- Unit heuristic (anchor metric): RM per critical asset contract optimized + SLA compliance.

## Baseline model (defensible assumptions)

- Base inputs:
  - Annual service contract value: RM 25M
  - Overlap/waste: 2% (duplicate coverage, unused tiers)
  - SLA penalties / credits missed: 1% potential
- Modeled baseline:
  - Modeled leakage = RM 25M x (2% + 1%) = RM 750k/year

## Impact model

- Primary lever: renewal control + overlap removal
- Secondary lever: SLA and obligation tracking
- Result metrics (modeled):
  - recover 20-40% of modeled leakage in year 1

## Proof plan (no named claims)

- Operational proof: asset-linked contract registry + renewal calendar.
- Workflow proof: approval chain for contract changes.
- Export/report proof: SLA breach log and renewal audit trail.

## Discovery validation (what to measure first)

- Confirm baseline: service spend by category (OEM vs third party), overlap rate, and SLA tier usage.
- Confirm buyer proof bar: asset-to-contract linkage requirement and SLA reporting format.

## Slide-by-slide notes (rewrite Slides 2-8)

2. Problem:
- "Service contracts are clinical uptime." Emphasize compliance, audits, and response time.

3. Baseline economics:
- show service spend base and modeled leakage from overlaps.

4. Value levers:
- contract repository tied to assets/vendors, obligations/SLA tiers.

5. Impact:
- translate to reduced overlap and fewer missed SLA credits.

6. How it works:
- repository, approval, SLA tracking.

7. Investment and ROI:
- ROI = small % recovered on service spend.

8. Proof:
- show asset-linked contracts + SLA log + audit trail.

## Pilot and risk reversal

- Scope: one hospital + critical asset contracts (top 30)
- Timeline: 45 days (load week 1-2; validate SLA tiers week 3-4; run renewal/obligation workflows week 5-6)
- Success criteria:
  - 100% renewal visibility for top 30
  - SLA tiers and obligations captured for 90%+

## Do / Don't

- Do: keep it operational and audit-friendly.
- Don't: claim medical outcomes.
