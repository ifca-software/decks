# ContractX - IT / Managed Services (Segment Spec)

## Segment

- Product: ContractX
- Segment: IT / managed services
- Primary buyer: COO / commercial lead
- Secondary buyers: Legal, Delivery, Finance
- Typical environment: MSAs + SOWs, renewals, SLAs, credits, frequent redlines

## Positioning

- One-line promise: Reduce redline time and protect renewals with a single renewal and SLA view.
- Status quo: redlines in email, renewal tracker in spreadsheets, SLA credits handled ad hoc.
- Unit heuristic (anchor metric): days removed from redline cycle + % renewal revenue protected.

## Baseline model (defensible assumptions)

- Base inputs:
  - Average cycle time: 42 days
  - Annual contract value: RM 60M
  - Leakage: 1% missed renewals + 1% SLA/pricing slippage = 2%
- Modeled baseline:
  - leakage = RM 60M x 2% = RM 1.2M/year

## Impact model

- Primary lever: template + clause library reduces redlines and review time
- Secondary lever: renewal calendar and SLA breach log reduce missed credits
- Result metrics (modeled):
  - 20-35% faster cycle time
  - recover 0.5-1.5% of contract value (modeled)

## Proof plan (no named claims)

- Operational proof: renewal pipeline dashboard + SLA breach log.
- Workflow proof: redline/version history + approvals.
- Export/report proof: audit trail export for changes.

## Discovery validation (what to measure first)

- Confirm baseline: redline cycle by step (legal vs approvals) and renewal forecast accuracy.
- Confirm buyer proof bar: required audit log granularity and SLA breach evidence.

## Slide-by-slide notes (rewrite Slides 2-8)

2. Problem:
- "Revenue depends on renewals and SLAs." Make it about forecastability.

3. Baseline economics:
- show cycle time, annual contract value, modeled leakage.

4. Value levers:
- clause library, approval workflows, renewal calendar, SLA log.

5. Impact:
- translate to faster revenue start and reduced leakage.

6. How it works:
- MSA/SOW structure, change control, renewals.

7. Investment and ROI:
- ROI = small % of contract value recovered + faster cycle time.

8. Proof:
- show renewal dashboard + redline workflow.

## Pilot and risk reversal

- Scope: standard templates + one delivery unit
- Timeline: 30 days (template + clause library week 1; approvals week 2; pilot deals week 3-4)
- Success criteria:
  - cycle time down >= 20% for pilot deals
  - renewal visibility 100% for pilot customers

## Do / Don't

- Do: show version history and approvals.
- Don't: overpromise cycle time without defining baseline.
