# ContractX Segment Deck Plan

Use: `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/contractx/outline.md`

## Objective

Sell ContractX as a leakage-reduction and speed-to-revenue system:

- renewal risk visible early
- obligations and SLAs enforced
- redlines and approvals faster

Anchor unit heuristic:

- % of annual contract value recovered/protected
- RM per renewal saved

## Segment variants to build

- REIT / property groups
- Healthcare groups
- IT / managed services
- Manufacturing procurement
- Energy / utilities
- Telecom / enterprise

Segment specs:

- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/contractx/segments/reit-property-groups.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/contractx/segments/healthcare-groups.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/contractx/segments/it-managed-services.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/contractx/segments/manufacturing-procurement.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/contractx/segments/energy-utilities.md`
- `_jobs/ifca/_deliverables/_decks/contractx/segments/telecom-enterprise.md`

## What changes by segment

- Slide 2: renewals/escalations vs OEM service SLAs vs MSA/SOW redlines
- Slide 3: baseline includes annual contract value, renewal volume, miss rate
- Slide 7: ROI framed as small % recovery on a clear base (annual contract value)
- Slide 8: proof artifacts: renewal calendar, obligation tracker, audit trail

## Defensible numbers (recommended approach)

- Pick a base: annual contract value (ACV total)
- Leakage = (missed renewals + pricing slippage + SLA penalties)
- Recovery = leakage x conservative recovery rate (e.g. 20-40%)

Avoid claims like "near zero" unless you can define and measure miss rate.

## Evidence artifacts to prepare

- Renewal calendar with alerts
- Clause library + version history
- Obligation tracker (who, what, when)
- SLA breach log (where applicable)

## Pilot offer (recommended)

- Scope: top 100 contracts, 1 business unit, 30 days
- Success criteria:
  - 100% renewal visibility for pilot set
  - cycle time down >= 20% for new contracts in pilot
