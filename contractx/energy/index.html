<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Reality" data-slug="reality">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Lead with the obligation enforcement angle. Energy companies have long-term contracts (5-15 years) with complex performance clauses, KPIs, and penalty schedules. Ask: "How many performance obligations in your top 20 contracts are being tracked right now?" The answer is almost always "we know they exist but nobody is actively monitoring them."</p>
    <h4>Segment positioning</h4>
    <p>Energy and utilities companies operate in a heavily regulated environment. They have sophisticated SCADA systems for operations but primitive contract management. The gap between operational discipline and contract discipline is the sell.</p>
    <h4>Who to target</h4>
    <p>Head of Contracts or VP of Procurement. In regulated utilities, the compliance officer is also a key stakeholder because contract traceability feeds into regulatory reporting. Get procurement and compliance in the same room.</p>

            <h3>Missed SLA Credits — RM 800,000/year</h3>
            <p>Energy service contracts contain complex SLA and KPI frameworks — uptime guarantees, response time commitments, and performance penalties. Without systematic breach logging, penalty credits go uncollected.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Example:</strong> O&M contractor guarantees 98% plant availability — actual availability was 96.5% for 3 months, but the shortfall was not formally documented with timestamps</li>
              <li><strong>Penalty structure:</strong> Typical penalty is 1-3% of monthly contract value per percentage point below target, but only 15-20% of breaches are captured with sufficient evidence</li>
              <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> RM 100M contract value x 0.8% in uncollected penalty credits = RM 800K</li>

            <h3>Terms Slippage — RM 700,000/year</h3>
            <p>Long-term energy contracts contain dozens of obligations — reporting deadlines, maintenance schedules, insurance renewals, environmental compliance milestones. Without tracking, obligations lapse silently.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Example:</strong> Contractor obligated to provide quarterly performance reports and annual equipment recertification — 3 of 8 obligations were overdue by 60+ days with no escalation</li>
              <li><strong>Financial impact:</strong> Lapsed obligations weaken the company's position in disputes and audits — settlement costs and regulatory penalties</li>
              <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> 0.7% of RM 100M contract value in obligation-related losses and weakened negotiating position = RM 700K</li>

            <h3>Missed Renewals — RM 600,000/year</h3>
            <p>Energy contracts include ancillary agreements (insurance, environmental monitoring, equipment leases) that renew on different cycles. Missing a renewal creates coverage gaps or locks in stale terms.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>High-value contracts:</strong> A single turbine maintenance agreement can be RM 5-10M — missing the renewal window means auto-renewal at last year's rate plus 3-5% escalation</li>
              <li><strong>Coverage gaps:</strong> Expired insurance or environmental monitoring contracts create regulatory exposure</li>
              <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> 5-8 missed renewals on high-value contracts x 1.5-2% overpayment = RM 600K</li>

            <h3>Manual Compliance Tracking — RM 400,000/year</h3>
            <p>Energy companies face regulatory audits from the Energy Commission, DOE, and DOSH. Contract traceability — who approved what, when, and under which terms — is a core audit requirement.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Labour cost:</strong> Contracts team spends 3-4 weeks per audit cycle gathering evidence from emails, shared drives, and filing cabinets</li>
              <li><strong>External audit fees:</strong> Auditors charge premium rates when evidence is manual — estimated RM 80-120K in additional fees per audit cycle</li>
              <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> Direct labour (RM 200K) + audit fee premium (RM 100K) + regulatory risk cost (RM 100K) = RM 400K</li>

<!-- ===== 4. VALUE CREATION ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="Value Creation" data-slug="value">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Walk through the before/after cards. The RM 750K number is 30% of RM 2.5M — conservative because energy contracts are long-term and some obligation enforcement takes 6-12 months to fully realise. Stress: "These are contracts you already have and obligations you already negotiated. ContractX does not change the contracts — it enforces what is already in them."</p>
    <h4>Objection handling</h4>
    <p>"Our contracts team already tracks obligations" — Ask: "Can you show me a dashboard right now with every obligation, its owner, its deadline, and its status?" If they cannot, tracking is informal. ContractX makes it systematic.</p>
    <p>"RM 750K is small relative to our RM 100M spend" — That is 0.75% — pure bottom-line recovery from enforcing terms that already exist. It requires no renegotiation, no vendor confrontation, just systematic tracking. And RM 750K is Year 1 — the number grows as more contracts are loaded.</p>
    <h4>Key framing</h4>
    <p>For energy companies, frame ContractX as a risk and compliance tool, not just a cost tool. Untracked obligations = regulatory risk. Unenforced SLAs = performance risk. The board cares about governance; the operations team cares about vendor accountability.</p>

<!-- ===== 5. MODELED IMPACT ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-white" data-title="Modeled Impact" data-slug="impact">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Key insight</h4>
    <p>Energy contracts are long-term (5-15 years) with embedded obligations that compound over time. A missed obligation in Year 1 weakens the company's position for the entire remaining contract term. ContractX does not just enforce today's obligations — it builds the evidence base that strengthens every future renegotiation and dispute resolution.</p>
    <h4>Conversation steer</h4>
    <p>Ask: "Of these three — obligation tracking, SLA enforcement, or renewal visibility — which one would your board most want to see on a dashboard?" The answer reveals the governance priority and the entry point for the pilot.</p>

        <h3>Obligation Tracking</h3>
        <p>A single O&M contract for a power plant can contain 30-50 distinct obligations — quarterly reporting, equipment inspections, spare parts stocking, insurance renewals, environmental compliance milestones. Without systematic tracking, obligations lapse silently.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before:</strong> Obligations noted during contract signing but not tracked post-execution — the contracts team discovers lapses during audits or disputes, months after the deadline</li>
          <li><strong>After:</strong> Every obligation extracted, assigned to a named owner, and tracked with automated deadline alerts. Dashboard shows red/amber/green status across all contracts.</li>
          <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Obligation compliance rate improves from 60-70% to 90%+ — strengthening the company's position in every vendor interaction and audit</li>

        <h3>SLA Enforcement</h3>
        <p>Energy service contracts specify performance KPIs — plant availability, response times, heat rate guarantees. Penalty clauses are negotiated carefully but enforced poorly because evidence is not systematically collected.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before:</strong> Operations team notes underperformance informally — by month-end, the specific timestamps and evidence needed to invoke penalty clauses are lost</li>
          <li><strong>After:</strong> Every performance event logged with timestamp, KPI measurement, and contractual threshold. Penalty calculation runs automatically against the contract terms.</li>
          <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Penalty credit recovery increases from 15-20% to 70-80% of eligible breaches — recovering RM 400-600K per year on a RM 100M portfolio</li>

        <h3>Renewal Visibility</h3>
        <p>Energy contracts include long-term master agreements and shorter-term ancillary contracts (insurance, environmental monitoring, equipment leases). The ancillary contracts renew frequently and are often forgotten until a gap emerges.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before:</strong> Turbine maintenance contract renewal is on the CEO's radar, but the RM 500K environmental monitoring agreement expiring next month is not — creating a regulatory gap</li>

<!-- ===== 7. INVESTMENT & ROI ===== -->
<div class="slide bg-navy" data-title="The Investment" data-slug="roi">
  <template data-sales-notes>
    <h4>Approach</h4>
    <p>Let the 3.8x ROI sit, then contextualise: "RM 200K per year against RM 100M in contract value is 0.002 of spend. You are paying two basis points to recover 75 basis points. The board will see this as a governance investment, not just a software subscription."</p>
    <h4>Pricing guidance</h4>
    <p>RM 200K/year is the standard price for up to RM 100M in contract value. For larger portfolios (RM 200M+), pricing scales to RM 320K. For pilot deals, offer a 60-day proof-of-value loading one contract category (e.g., all O&M contracts) to demonstrate obligation gaps and missed SLA credits.</p>
    <h4>Closing technique</h4>
    <p>Do not ask "are you interested?" — ask "should we start with your O&M contracts or your equipment lease portfolio?" Assume the close. O&M contracts are the highest-value entry point because they have the most performance obligations and SLA clauses.</p>

        <h3>ROI Methodology</h3>
        <p>Based on RM 200K/year investment vs RM 750K/year in recovered leakage across 4 categories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Missed SLA credits:</strong> RM 800K — 0.8% in uncollected penalty credits on RM 100M contract value</li>
          <li><strong>Terms slippage:</strong> RM 700K — 0.7% in obligation-related losses and weakened negotiating position</li>
          <li><strong>Missed renewals:</strong> RM 600K — 5-8 missed renewals on high-value contracts at 1.5-2% overpayment</li>
          <li><strong>Manual compliance:</strong> RM 400K — labour, audit fee premium, and regulatory risk cost</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Total leakage: RM 2.5M. Conservative 30% recovery = RM 750K.</p>
        <p>Net: RM 750K - RM 200K = RM 550K per year. ROI = 750K / 200K = <strong>3.8x</strong></p>
        <p>Payback period: 200K / (750K / 12) = <strong>3.2 months</strong></p>
